# `S²` is simply connected — reachable scaffolding for `#1b`

The backward headline `#1b` (`genus_zero_of_nonempty_homeo_sphere`,
`Jacobians/ProperDegree/DegreeOneSphere.lean`) and its transport helper
`Jacobians.simplyConnectedSpace_of_homeo_sphere` (`Jacobians/SphereTopology/GenusSphereBackward.lean`)
carry **`SimplyConnectedSpace (Metric.sphere (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) 1)`** as an
explicit hypothesis, because Mathlib provides only a `proof_wanted` for the Poincaré
conjecture and nothing about `π₁(Sⁿ)`.  This file assembles, with no gaps, every piece of
that instance *except* the single irreducible analytic/topological core — the abstract
**two-open van Kampen** statement, which Mathlib lacks entirely.

## The model: the Riemann sphere `OnePoint ℂ`

The repo's `S²` is reached through `RiemannSphere.homeoSphere : OnePoint ℂ ≃ₜ S²`
(`Jacobians/ProjectiveLine.lean`), so we prove simple-connectivity for the **more tractable**
model `OnePoint ℂ = ℂ ∪ {∞}` and transport along that homeomorphism (simple-connectivity is a
homeomorphism invariant, `Homeomorph.toHomotopyEquiv` + `simplyConnectedSpace_iff`).

`OnePoint ℂ` is covered by two opens, each **contractible** (hence simply connected):

* `U := {∞}ᶜ = range (↑) ≃ₜ ℂ` — the affine chart;
* `V := {0}ᶜ` — the `∞`-chart, `≃ₜ ℂ` via the inversion `invMap` (`z ↦ z⁻¹`, swapping `0 ↔ ∞`),
  so `V = invMap '' U`.

Their overlap `U ∩ V` is the finite nonzero locus `≃ₜ ℂ ∖ {0}`, which is **path-connected**
(`isPathConnected_compl_singleton_of_one_lt_rank`, `rank ℝ ℂ = 2 > 1`).  The whole space is
path-connected (`OnePoint`'s `ConnectedSpace` + `LocPathConnectedSpace`).

## What is proved here, and the one wall

* **Transport** to the exact target type — `simplyConnectedSpace_sphere_of_onePoint`.
* **`U` simply connected** — `isSimplyConnected_compl_infty`.
* **`V` simply connected** — `isSimplyConnected_compl_zero`.
* **`U ∪ V = univ`** and **`U ∩ V` path-connected** — `union_charts_eq_univ`,
  `isPathConnected_inter_charts`.
* **`OnePoint ℂ` path-connected** — free instance.

The **single wall** is the abstract engine

```
TwoOpenVanKampen :
  ∀ {Z} [TopologicalSpace Z] [PathConnectedSpace Z] {U V : Set Z},
    IsOpen U → IsOpen V → U ∪ V = univ →
    IsSimplyConnected U → IsSimplyConnected V → IsPathConnected (U ∩ V) →
    SimplyConnectedSpace Z
```

i.e. Seifert–van Kampen specialised to a two-element simply-connected open cover with
path-connected intersection.  **Mathlib has no Seifert–van Kampen for `π₁`** (the `VanKampen`
files are category-theoretic colimit/extensive-category notions; the only sphere-homotopy facts
are the `proof_wanted`s in `Mathlib/Geometry/Manifold/PoincareConjecture.lean`).  Its proof is a
genuine homotopy-theory development (Lebesgue-subdivide a loop into arcs each inside one chart,
route the joins through `U ∩ V`, and fill inductively): realistically several hundred to ~1–1.5k
LoC.  We therefore take it as an explicit hypothesis in the capstones
`simplyConnectedSpace_onePoint_of_vanKampen` and `simplyConnectedSpace_sphere_of_vanKampen`,
which compose it with all the (proven) side-conditions and the transport — leaving exactly that
one input to discharge, the same pattern the repo already uses downstream.

This is the one input Mathlib does not provide.  Stated as a `Prop`-valued abbreviation so the
capstones can take it as a single hypothesis. -/

connected subsets with path-connected intersection is simply connected.  This is the only piece
of the `SimplyConnectedSpace (OnePoint ℂ)` proof that Mathlib does not supply (no Seifert–van
Kampen for `π₁`); every *use* of it below has all side-conditions discharged. -/

Every side-condition (path-connectivity, the two simply-connected charts, the cover equation, the
path-connected overlap) is discharged above; only `vanKampen` itself — Seifert–van
Kampen for a two-element open cover, absent from Mathlib — is taken as input. -/

Transports `simplyConnectedSpace_onePoint_of_vanKampen` along `homeoSphere : OnePoint ℂ ≃ₜ S²`

`Jacobians.simplyConnectedSpace_of_homeo_sphere` and `genus_zero_of_nonempty_homeo_sphere`
consume; supplying `TwoOpenVanKampen` discharges `#1b`'s backward simple-connectivity input. -/
