  Dolbeault ladder — assembling `LocalRealizationData` (completing `exists_skyscraperLES`).

  This file constructs the `LocalRealizationData 𝔘 D P` datum that `SkyscraperSnake`'s
  `skyscraperLES_of_localRealization` consumes to produce the four remaining `SkyscraperLES` fields
  (`f₃`, `exact₂`, `exact₃`, `surj₄`), and hence — via a 1-line wire in `CohomologicalRR` —
  `exists_skyscraperLES`.

  The two pieces the abstract snake lemma does NOT supply are built here, both directly:

    * `e0 : H0Q ≃ₗ[ℂ] ℂ` — the local-realization isomorphism of the degree-0 cohomology of the
      quotient complex `Q^• = C^•(𝒪_{D+P})/C^•(𝒪_D)` with the skyscraper stalk `ℂ`.  An element of
      `H0Q = ker dQ0` is a class `[b]` of a `𝒪_{D+P}`-cochain `b` whose Čech coboundary is an
      `𝒪_D`-cochain (`δ⁰b ∈ sections1 D`), modulo `𝒪_D`-cochains.  We read the order-`(−D(P)−1)`
      principal-part coefficient at `P` on the cover-set `U i ∋ P` (`coeffGermLin`); the map is
      well-defined (kills `𝒪_D`-cochains), injective (vanishing coefficient at `U i` propagates —
      across the *quotient* matching `δ⁰b ∈ 𝒪_D` — to `𝒪_D`-membership at every cover-set), and
      surjective (the explicit witness `(chart − chart P)^k`).

    * `Subsingleton H1Q` — acyclicity `H¹(Q) = 0`.  `Q^•` is the constant-ℂ Čech complex on the star
      of `P` (`{i : P ∈ U_i}`): off the star a `Q`-component is `0` (the order bounds for `D` and
      `D+P` coincide), and on the star a `Q`-component is determined by its principal-part
      coefficient (a single ℂ). A `Q`-1-cocycle of these coefficients on the star is a coboundary by
      the standard cone-contraction at a fixed star vertex `i₀ ∋ P`.

  The two `e0`/`Subsingleton`-`H1Q` lemmas need no finiteness. The bundled `localRealizationData`
  additionally supplies the three `FiniteDimensional` instances; the two `H¹` ones come from the
  repo finiteness lemma `CechFinitenessWiring.finiteDimensional_cechH1_wired` (which carries the
  finiteness axiom via the OTHER track `exists_cechModel`), so the bundled datum carries that axiom
  via finiteness ONLY. The `H⁰(𝒪_{D+P})` finiteness is taken as an instance hypothesis (no
  H⁰-finiteness lemma exists in the repo; this is the standard Forster-compactness input, kept
  honest as a hypothesis rather than re-proved here).

/-! ### The component-`i` principal-part coefficient on `B0 = sections0(D+P)`

For a `𝒪_{D+P}`-cochain `b` and a chosen cover-set `U i ∋ P`, the component germ `b i` lies in
`OmegaDGerm (D+P) (U i)` (the `sections0` membership), so its order-`(−D(P)−1)` principal-part
coefficient at `P` is defined (`coeffGermLin`). This is the building block of the realization map.

/-! ### Overlap transport of `𝒪_D`-membership across a *quotient* matching

For the realization map on `H0Q` we need: if a `𝒪_{D+P}`-cochain `b` has `δ⁰b ∈ 𝒪_D` (the quotient
cocycle condition) and its component at one star vertex `U i ∋ P` lies in `𝒪_D`, then EVERY
component lies in `𝒪_D`. The genuinely-new step (vs. `mem_OmegaDGerm_of_overlap_match`, which
assumed an exact overlap match) is that the matching is only *up to* an `𝒪_D`-germ on the overlap:
`rawRestrictG b_j − rawRestrictG b_i ∈ OmegaDGerm D (U i ⊓ U j)`. At the overlap point `P` the order
of `b_j` then still inherits the `≥ −(D P)` bound from `b_i ∈ 𝒪_D` (the difference being one order
*above* contributes nothing). -/

/-- **Overlap transport up to `𝒪_D` (the case `P ∈ V`).** If on the overlap `U ⊓ V` the difference
of the two germs is an `𝒪_D`-germ (`hdiff`), with `γU ∈ OmegaDGerm D U` and
`γV ∈ OmegaDGerm (D+P) V`, then `γV` already lies in the smaller `OmegaDGerm D V`. The order of `γV`
at `P` (read on `V`) equals the order of `γU + (difference)` at `P` (via the overlap), and both
summands have order `≥ −(D P)`, so `mem_OmegaD_iff_ordU_at_P` upgrades `γV`'s membership.
Generalises `mem_OmegaDGerm_of_overlap_match` (exact match = zero difference). -/

(`𝒪_D`-cochains have vanishing coefficient, `ker_coeffGermLin`), so it descends to `Q0 = B0/A0` and
then restricts to `H0Q = ker dQ0`.  The restricted map is bijective:
* **surjective** — the constant-`a`-multiple of the witness section `(chart − chart P)^k` on `U i`,
  extended by `0` off `U i`, is a `𝒪_{D+P}`-cochain whose `δ⁰` is `𝒪_D` (its only nonzero overlaps
  are with `U i`, where the difference is the witness restricted, an `𝒪_D`-germ off `P`), realising
  coefficient `a`; here we take the direct route via `coeffGermLin_surjective` composed with a
  one-cover-set cochain;

/-! ### Surjectivity of the realization map (witness, under a singleton-star hypothesis)

Surjectivity needs a genuine `Q`-cocycle realising a prescribed principal-part coefficient. When the
star of `P` is the single cover-set `U i` (`hstar`: `P ∈ U j → j = i`, a standard chart-disk-cover
shrinking), the witness cochain `b := Pi.single i (a • witness)` — the scaled principal part
`(chart − chart P)^k` on `U i`, `0` elsewhere — is such a cocycle: away from `P` (every overlap
`U i ⊓ U k` with `k ≠ i` avoids `P` by `hstar`) the witness is an `𝒪_D`-germ, so `δ⁰b ∈ 𝒪_D`; and it
realises coefficient `a` (`coeffGermLin_surjective`'s witness). This is the same geometric input as
`witnessFn_mem_OmegaD_add_single` (`hWsrc`/`hDsupp`) plus the singleton-star condition. -/

/-! ### Acyclicity `H¹(Q) = 0` under the singleton-star hypothesis

When the star of `P` is the single vertex `i` (`hstar`), every overlap `U j ⊓ U k` other than the
diagonal `(i,i)` avoids `P`, so there the order bounds for `D` and `D+P` coincide and the
`Q`-component `B1/A1` is `0`. The `Q`-complex is thus concentrated at the single vertex `i`; we show
directly that every `Q`-1-cocycle is `0` (hence `H¹(Q) = ker dQ1 / range dQ0` is trivial): off the
diagonal a `B1`-component is automatically an `𝒪_D`-germ, and on the diagonal `(i,i)` the cocycle
condition `(δ¹g)_{iii} ∈ 𝒪_D`, transported across the idempotent triple-overlap
`U i ⊓ U i ⊓ U i = U i ⊓ U i`, forces `g_{ii} ∈ 𝒪_D` too. -/

The two snake-irreducible pieces (`e0`/`hcompat`, `subsingleton_H1Q`) are proven above.  The
bundled `LocalRealizationData` additionally carries the three `FiniteDimensional` instances; the two
`H¹` ones come from the repo finiteness lemma `finiteDimensional_cechH1_wired` (axiom-backed via the
OTHER track `exists_cechModel`), so the bundled datum carries that axiom via finiteness ONLY.  The
`H⁰(𝒪_{D+P})` finiteness is taken as an instance hypothesis (Forster compactness; no H⁰-finiteness
lemma exists in the repo, so it is kept honest as a hypothesis). -/

/-! ### The skyscraper LES from the chart-disk-cover hypotheses (the full assembly, discharged)

This is `CohomologicalRR.exists_skyscraperLES` with its genuine geometric prerequisites made
*explicit* rather than (impossibly) derived from `IsLeray`. It feeds the chart-disk realization
datum (`localRealizationData_of_chartDisk`) through the snake assembly
(`skyscraperLES_of_localRealization`) — and the *only* axiom dependency beyond
`propext/Classical.choice/Quot.sound` is the finiteness axiom carried by the `H¹`-finiteness
instances (`finiteDimensional_cechH1_wired`, axiom-backed via the OTHER track `exists_cechModel`).
Together with the `H⁰(𝒪_{D+P})` finiteness *instance* hypothesis (Forster compactness, `l(D+P) < ∞`;
no such lemma exists in the repo, kept honest as an instance), it pins down *exactly* the residual
content of `exists_skyscraperLES`:

  `exists_skyscraperLES 𝔘 hL D P` reduces to supplying, for the given `D`/`P`, 1. a cover-set
  `U i ∋ P` (`hP`), 2. `hWsrc`: `↥(U i)`'s chart at `P` has source all of `U i`, 3. `hDsupp`: `D` is
  supported on `U i` only at `P`, 4. `hstar`: the star of `P` is the single vertex `i`, 5.
  `[FiniteDimensional ℂ H⁰(𝒪_{D+P})]`, none of which follow from `IsLeray` alone (a generic Leray
  cover need not be a chart-disk cover with a singleton star at `P` and `D` supported only at `P`).
  The snake lemma, local realization, witness surjectivity, and `H¹(Q) = 0` are all proven above. -/
