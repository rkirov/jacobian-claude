# Cut-surface bridge: proving the Riemann bilinear relations

This file formalizes the *analytic heart* of the period-lattice goal (#7): the two Riemann bilinear
relations R1 (vanishing) and R2 (positivity) are **proven** from a single, more primitive topological
input — the **boundary word** of a canonical dissection realized as a cut surface (a chart
`cut : box → X`, holomorphic on the interior, a diffeo onto `X` minus the cuts, whose boundary
traverses the loops `a₁b₁a₁⁻¹b₁⁻¹⋯`).

The boundary word is the identity `∑ₖ(A_{ki}B_{kj} − B_{ki}A_{kj}) = ∮_{∂box}(F_i · h_j dz)` (and a
conjugated variant), where `h_j = cut^*ω_j` is the pullback of the `j`-th holomorphic form and `F_i`
is a primitive of `h_i`. Given it, R1/R2 are pure analysis:

* **R1** — the boundary integral of the *holomorphic* `F_i·h_j` over `∂box` is `0` by **Cauchy's
  theorem on the rectangle** (`Complex.integral_boundary_rect_eq_zero_of_differentiableOn`). Hence
  `∑ₖ(A_{ki}B_{kj} − B_{ki}A_{kj}) = 0`, i.e. `AᵀB = BᵀA`.
* **R2** — the conjugated boundary integral is `−(i/2)⁻¹` times a strictly positive area integral
  (`Jacobians.boundaryForm_pos`), giving positive-definiteness of the period Hermitian form.

Only the boundary word stays isolated (it encodes the surface's polygonal schema, which Mathlib
lacks); the relations themselves are theorems.

/-- **Riemann's first bilinear relation, from the boundary word.** Given period blocks `A, B`,
pullbacks `h_j` with primitives `F_i`, and the boundary-word identity
`(AᵀB − BᵀA) i j = ∮_{∂box}(F_i·h_j) dz`, the relation `AᵀB = BᵀA` holds: each `F_i·h_j` is
holomorphic, so its box contour integral vanishes by Cauchy. (The boundary word is supplied by the
cut surface and is itself a theorem there — see `CutSurface`.) -/

/-- **Per-handle cancellation = the boundary word, PROVEN from the gluing.** This is the geometric
heart of the boundary word for a *single handle* (one `a`-loop, one `b`-loop): the box contour
integral `∮_{∂box}(F·h dz)` equals the antisymmetric period product `A·B' − B·A'`, derived purely
from the cut chart's **gluing** and the primitive's **jumps** across the cuts.

Hypotheses (all supplied by a cut chart that identifies the box's opposite edges):
* **gluing** `hper_a`/`hper_b` — the pullback `h = cut^*ω` takes equal values on identified edges
  (the chart glues `x ↦ x+i` and `y·i ↦ 1+y·i`);
* **jumps** `hjump_a`/`hjump_b` — the primitive `F` of `h` increases by a fixed period across each
  cut: by `B` (the `b`-period of the `F`-form) crossing the `a`-cut, and by `A` (the `a`-period)
  crossing the `b`-cut. This is the monodromy fact "primitive jump = period";
* **periods** `hAper`/`hBper` — the `a`-period `A' = ∫₀¹ h(x) dx` and `b`-period `B' = i∫₀¹ h(yi) dy`
  of the `h`-form, read off the bottom/left edges.

Then `∮_{∂box}(F·h) = A·B' − B·A'`. (Bottom−top collapses to `−B·A'` via the `a`-cut jump;
right−left to `A·B'` via the `b`-cut jump. Pure interval-integral algebra; no surface topology — that
lives in *realizing* the gluing/jump data, i.e. the isolated `exists_cutSurface`.) Combined with box
Cauchy (`rectBoundaryIntegral_eq_zero_of_differentiableOn`) this gives `A·B' = B·A'` — Riemann's R1
for one handle. The general-`g` boundary word sums `g` such handles over the `4g`-gon. -/
