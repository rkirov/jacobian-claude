# Two-open Seifert–van Kampen for `π₁`, and `S²` simply connected (unconditional)

This file discharges the single remaining hypothesis of `Jacobians/SphereSimplyConnected.lean`:
the abstract **two-open van Kampen** statement `TwoOpenVanKampen`.  Combined with the (already
proven, complete) side-conditions there it yields the **unconditional**

```
instance : SimplyConnectedSpace (Metric.sphere (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) 1)
```

so every downstream consumer of `#1b` picks it up with no remaining input.

## The statement

`TwoOpenVanKampen` says: a path-connected space `Z` covered by two open simply-connected sets
`U`, `V` with path-connected intersection `U ∩ V` is simply connected.  Mathlib has no
Seifert–van Kampen for `π₁`, so this is built here from scratch.

## The proof

By `simply_connected_iff_loops_nullhomotopic` it suffices, given `PathConnectedSpace Z`, to
nullhomotope an arbitrary loop `γ : Path x x`.

1. **Lebesgue subdivision.**  `{γ⁻¹ U, γ⁻¹ V}` is an open cover of the compact interval `I`; the
   Lebesgue number lemma gives `n` so that each subinterval `[k/(n+1), (k+1)/(n+1)]` maps into
   `U` or into `V`.  Writing `tᵢ = i/(n+1)`, the subpaths `γₖ := γ.subpath (t k) (t (k+1))` each
   lie in one chart, and `Path.Homotopic.concat_subpath` identifies their concatenation with `γ`.

2. **Spokes through the overlap.**  Pick a basepoint `o ∈ U ∩ V`.  For each junction `qₖ = γ(tₖ)`,
   path-connectivity of the relevant chart provides a spoke `cₖ` from `o` to `qₖ` lying in that
   chart; we arrange `cₖ` to lie in `U ∩ V` whenever `qₖ` is an *interior* junction (so that the
   adjacent conjugated loops stay inside their charts).

3. **Per-arc nullhomotopy.**  Each conjugated loop `Lₖ := cₖ · γₖ · c_{k+1}⁻¹` lies entirely in a
   single chart (`U` or `V`), hence is nullhomotopic there; transported to `Z` it is nullhomotopic
   (`isSimplyConnected_iff_exists_homotopy_refl_forall_mem`).

4. **Telescoping.**  In the fundamental groupoid quotient the product
   `L₀ ≫ L₁ ≫ ⋯ ≫ Lₙ` telescopes (the `c_{k}⁻¹ ≫ c_{k}` cancel) to `c₀ ≫ ⟦γ⟧ ≫ c_{n}⁻¹`; with
   `c₀` and `c_{last}` the identity and each `Lₖ` the identity, this collapses `⟦γ⟧` to the
   identity.

/-! ### The telescoping core (fundamental-groupoid quotient algebra)

Everything here is pure algebra in `Path.Homotopic.Quotient`: spokes `c` from a base point to the
junctions `q`, arcs `F` between consecutive junctions, and the hypothesis that every conjugated
loop is nullhomotopic.  The conclusion is that the (quotient class of the) concatenation of arcs,
conjugated by the two end spokes, is the identity. -/
