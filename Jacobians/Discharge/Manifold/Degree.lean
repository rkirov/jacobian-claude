/-! # Degree of a holomorphic map between compact Riemann surfaces

This file provides a *fibre-cardinality* candidate body for `ContMDiff.degree`,
upgrading the constant-vs-non-constant indicator (`degreeStub`) toward the
classical definition

```
deg(f) = |f ⁻¹' {y}|   for any regular value y : Y.
```

## What is honest in this file

* For **constant** `f`, `degreeFiber f hf = 0` unconditionally.
* For **non-constant** `f`, `degreeFiber f hf` extracts a natural number from a
  packaged witness bundle (`RegularValueWitness`) using `Classical.choice` on
  the existence of such a witness. The witness records:
  - a chosen value `y₀ : Y`,
  - a proof that the fibre `f ⁻¹' {y₀}` is finite, and
  - the cardinality is then `(h.toFinset).card`.
  When no witness exists in `Classical.choice`'s sense at this mathlib pin
  (because the deep theorem below is missing), the definition falls back to
  `0`. This matches `degreeStub`'s constant-case answer and is strictly more
  informative than `degreeStub` whenever a witness *does* exist.

## What is owed (and is the deep classical input)

For a non-constant holomorphic map `f : X → Y` between compact connected
Riemann surfaces, the following are classical and **not yet in mathlib at the
pin**:

1. **Properness with finite fibres.** Every fibre `f ⁻¹' {y}` is a finite
   subset of `X` (using `IsCompact.finite_of_discrete` once one knows the
   fibre is discrete, which uses the identity theorem for analytic functions).
2. **Existence of a regular value.** The set of critical values
   `{y : Y | ∃ x ∈ f ⁻¹' {y}, ramification index ≥ 2}` is finite, so its
   complement is non-empty (in fact, of full measure / open dense).
3. **Constancy of fibre cardinality across regular values.** This is the
   topological-degree statement; it relies on the local normal form
   `z ↦ z ^ k` for ramified holomorphic maps and a covering-space argument on
   `Y \ critical values`.

The first two together produce a `RegularValueWitness f`. The third is what
makes `degreeFiber f hf` independent of the chosen witness. None of (1)–(3)
are formalised at this pin; their statements are recorded as `Owed.*`
docstrings below for downstream.

## Why a separate definition (and not editing `_root_.ContMDiff.degree`)

`Basic.lean`'s `_root_.ContMDiff.degree f hf : ℕ` signature is locked. This
file provides `Jacobians.Discharge.ContMDiff.degreeFiber` as a strict upgrade
candidate that matches the same signature shape (no extra arguments at the
call site beyond `f` and `hf`). When (1)–(3) above land in mathlib, the body
of `_root_.ContMDiff.degree` in `Basic.lean` can be retargeted from
`degreeStub` to `degreeFiber` without touching any caller.

## Main definitions

* `Jacobians.Discharge.ContMDiff.RegularValueWitness f` — a chosen value `y₀ : Y`
  together with a proof that the fibre over `y₀` is finite. Existence of this
  witness for non-constant analytic `f` between compact RS is the deep
  classical input.
* `Jacobians.Discharge.ContMDiff.degreeFiber f hf : ℕ` — `0` if `f` is constant;
  otherwise `Classical.choice`-extracted fibre cardinality (falling back to
  `0` if no `RegularValueWitness` exists at the pin).

## Compatibility with `degreeStub`

* `degreeFiber_const` matches `degreeStub_const`: constant maps have degree 0.
* `degreeFiber f hf = 0` whenever no `RegularValueWitness f` exists — same as
  `degreeStub` would give in the absence of any classical witness.

/-! ## The witness bundle

A `RegularValueWitness f` packages a chosen value `y₀ : Y` together with a
proof that the fibre `f ⁻¹' {y₀}` is finite. This is the minimal structural
data needed to define a fibre cardinality without changing the signature of
`_root_.ContMDiff.degree`.

For a non-constant holomorphic map between compact connected Riemann surfaces,
existence of such a witness is a classical theorem (see file docstring item
1+2). At this mathlib pin neither (1) nor (2) is formalised, so the
`Nonempty (RegularValueWitness f)` hypothesis is the gap. -/

  /-- Chosen value in the codomain. -/

/-! ## Regular-value strengthened witness (ZZ172 corrected form)

`RegularValueWitness` carries only `fiber_finite`, which is structurally too
weak: classical "fibre cardinality is constant" requires the chosen value
*also* be a regular value (no preimage with degenerate chart-pullback
derivative). A `RegularValueWitness` over a critical point can have a smaller
fibre than a generic one (counts drop at branch points), so any "constant
fibre card" statement quantifying over arbitrary `RegularValueWitness` is
*false* as written.

`RegularValueWitnessReg f` strengthens `RegularValueWitness f` with a
**chart-pullback-derivative-nonzero certificate** inlined directly into the
structure: for every preimage point `x ∈ f ⁻¹' {value}`, the derivative
of the chart-pullback `(chartAt ℂ value) ∘ f ∘ (chartAt ℂ x).symm` at
`(chartAt ℂ x) x` is nonzero.

This is the analytic content of "value is a regular value of `f`" and is
exactly the shape consumed by `LocalSheetData.ofContMDiffMfderivNeZero`
(`Manifold/LocalSheetDataFromContMDiff.lean`, ZZ169). -/

/-- A **regular** regular-value witness for `f`. Strengthens
`RegularValueWitness` with a chart-pullback-derivative-nonzero certificate:
for every preimage point `x ∈ f ⁻¹' {value}`, the derivative of the
chart-pullback `(chartAt ℂ value) ∘ f ∘ (chartAt ℂ x).symm` at
`(chartAt ℂ x) x` is nonzero.

This is the analytic content of "`value` is a regular value of `f`",

/-! ## The degree

A drop-in replacement for `degreeStub` that, when a `RegularValueWitnessReg`
is classically available, returns a *real* fibre cardinality rather than an
indicator. -/

/-- The **degree** of an analytic map `f : X → Y` between compact Riemann
surfaces, as a fibre cardinality.

* For constant `f`, returns `0` (matching the convention in challenge item 9
  and `degreeStub`).
* For non-constant `f`, returns the cardinality of *some* regular fibre,
  selected via `Classical.choice` on the existence of a `RegularValueWitnessReg`
  (a witness whose chosen value carries a chart-pullback-derivative-nonzero
  certificate at every preimage; this is the analytic content of "regular
  value"). If no such regular witness is classically available, falls back
  to `0`.

The well-definedness — independence of the chosen witness — is the deep
classical input that is **not** discharged here. See file docstring items
(2)–(3) for what is owed.

**ZZ-RegFix correction.** Earlier the `Classical.choice` was on
`Nonempty (RegularValueWitness f)`, which carries no regularity certificate;
`Classical.choice` could pick a branch-point witness whose fibre cardinality
is strictly smaller than the topological degree. Switching to
`RegularValueWitnessReg f` bakes the analytic regularity in, so the choice
is always at a regular value. Existence of a regular witness for
non-constant analytic `f` is discharged unconditionally in
`Manifold/RegularValueExistsRegUnconditional.lean`. -/

`degreeFiber` to be promoted from "structural skeleton with `Classical.choice`
fallback" to a fully honest definition. They are not proved here; they are
recorded as type-checking placeholders so that downstream files can grep for
`Owed.degree.` to find the dependency surface.

Each placeholder is a `Prop`-valued definition of the **statement** of the
classical theorem; we do **not** assume it (no `axiom`s). Discharging them is
out of scope for this round. -/

/-! ### Partial discharge of `fibres_finite_statement`

The full statement requires the analytic identity theorem on charts to ensure
fibres are discrete. We do not formalise the chart-level identity theorem at
this pin. We do however reduce `fibres_finite_statement` to a single named
topological hypothesis: **each fibre carries the discrete subspace topology**
(`IsDiscrete (f ⁻¹' {y})`). The reduction itself is purely topological:
continuity gives closedness, compactness of `X` upgrades closed to compact,
and a compact discrete subspace is finite (`IsCompact.finite`).

What is owed (and not formalised here) is the implication

  analytic, non-constant ⇒ ∀ y, IsDiscrete (f ⁻¹' {y}).

That is the chart-level identity theorem.
-/

/-- A fibre of a continuous map into a `T2` compact space is closed and hence
compact; if additionally the fibre carries the discrete subspace topology, it
is finite. This is the purely topological half of the identity-theorem
argument. -/

/-! ### Partial discharge of `regular_value_exists_statement`

A `RegularValueWitness f` needs only *some* `y₀ : Y` with finite fibre. The
classical statement gives much more (the *critical value set* is finite, hence
its complement contains many regular values). For the witness-existence
question alone, the much weaker fact "there is at least one `y` with finite
fibre" suffices. We record three reductions of decreasing strength:

* `regular_value_exists_of_some_fiber_finite`: from `∃ y, (f ⁻¹' {y}).Finite`.
* `regular_value_exists_of_fibres_finite`: from the full
  `fibres_finite_statement` (uses `ConnectedSpace Y → Nonempty Y`).
* `regular_value_exists_of_critical_values_finite`: from finiteness of the
  *critical-value set* together with `Infinite Y` — this is the form that
  exposes the actual analytic obligation (critical-point set is the zero set
  of `f'` in chart coords, discrete by the identity theorem, hence finite by
  compactness; its image is finite). -/

/-- Trivial reduction: a `RegularValueWitness f` is exactly an element of `Y`
together with finiteness of its fibre. So existence is equivalent to
`∃ y, (f ⁻¹' {y}).Finite`. -/

`fibres_finite_statement`), and `Y` is non-empty (free from

/-- **The intended reduction.** Reduce `regular_value_exists_statement` to the
*precise* analytic obligation: the **critical-value set is finite**.

Mathematically: if the critical-value set `C ⊆ Y` is finite and `Y` is
infinite, then `Y \ C` is non-empty; pick `y ∈ Y \ C`. By the local normal
form (`z ↦ z^k` with `k = 1` at non-critical points), `f` is locally injective
at every preimage of `y`, so the fibre `f ⁻¹' {y}` is discrete. Combined with
compactness of `X` (giving closedness then compactness of the fibre), this
yields a finite fibre, hence a `RegularValueWitness`.

Here we expose the obligation in its sharpest form: a hypothesis `h_crit`
producing, *for every non-constant analytic `f`*, a finite set
`C : Finset Y` containing all critical values, plus the local-injectivity
witness `h_disc` at non-critical values (the identity-theorem half is
isolated to `h_disc`).

This reduction makes the gap `regular_value_exists_statement` boil down to
`h_crit` + `h_disc` + `Infinite Y`, with everything else (closedness,
compactness, finite-from-compact-discrete) discharged. -/

Independence of the chosen `RegularValueWitness` — i.e. the topological-degree
well-definedness — has the following classical structure. The set of regular
values `R ⊆ Y` is the complement of the (finite) critical-value set. On `R`
the map `f` is a covering map, so the fibre-cardinality function

  `n : R → ℕ`,   `n y = |f ⁻¹' {y}|`

is *locally constant*. Since `R = Y \ C` with `C` finite and `Y` a connected
Riemann surface (real dimension `≥ 2`), `R` is connected. A locally constant
function on a (pre)connected space is constant. Hence any two regular-value
witnesses give the same fibre cardinality.

We do **not** prove "covering map ⇒ locally constant fibre cardinality" or
"connected minus finite is connected for real-dim ≥ 2 manifolds" at this pin:
both are classical and both are heavy enough to deserve their own files. We
instead reduce `fibre_card_well_defined_statement` to a single named
hypothesis — the **fibre-cardinality function exists, extends every witness,
and is constant on the regular-value support** — and discharge the rest. The
shape of the hypothesis exactly mirrors the form items (1)–(2) take above:
classical content is named, topological/structural plumbing is dispatched. -/

/-- A **fibre-cardinality function** packaging the data classical
covering-space theory provides. Recorded as a structure so downstream files
have a single named target: discharging
`fibre_card_well_defined_statement` reduces to producing one of these for
every non-constant analytic `f`.

Fields:
* `card_of`: the fibre-cardinality function on `Y` (or any superset of the
  regular-value set; we take all of `Y` for simplicity, since the value at a
  critical point is irrelevant for the witness-comparison argument).
* `card_of_witness`: every `RegularValueWitness w` has
  `card_of w.value = w.card`. This is a definitional compatibility: it says
  `card_of` agrees with the true fibre cardinality at every point that
  *carries* a witness — exactly the points the well-definedness statement
  ranges over.
* `card_of_constant`: `card_of` is constant when restricted to the witness
  values. This is the deep classical content (covering-space + connectedness
  of `Y \ critical-values`). -/

/-- **Sharper reduction: locally-constant fibre-cardinality on a preconnected
regular-value subtype.**

This form exposes the analytic obligation in covering-space shape, using the
subspace topology on the regular-value set `R ⊆ Y`.

* `card_of : Y → ℕ`, the fibre-cardinality function on `Y` (its value off
  regular values is irrelevant).
* `h_witness`: `card_of` reads off any witness's card.
* `h_supp`: every witness's value lies in `R`.
* `h_lc_sub`: `card_of` restricted to the subtype `R` is locally constant —
  this is exactly the covering-space content.
* `h_conn_sub`: the subtype `R` is preconnected — the topological content
  (a connected Riemann surface minus a finite set is preconnected, real
  dimension `≥ 2`).

The conclusion follows from
`IsLocallyConstant.apply_eq_of_isPreconnected`. -/
