/-! # Discharging the chart-pullback non-eventual-constancy hypothesis

ZZ38 (`ChartBallOffCentreWitnessDischarge.lean`) reduced
`fibres_finite_statement` end-to-end, modulo a single named hypothesis
`ChartPullbackNotEventuallyConstHypothesis X Y` asserting: for every
non-constant `C^ω` map `f : X → Y`, every `y₀ : Y`, and every fibre point
`x` of `y₀`, the chart pullback
`F = (chartAt ℂ y₀) ∘ f ∘ (chartAt ℂ x).symm` is **not** eventually equal
to `(chartAt ℂ y₀) y₀` near `(chartAt ℂ x) x`.

This file (ZZ43) provides the **manifold-side discharge**, modulo a single
named "chart-overlap propagation" hypothesis that captures the
path-walking analytic-continuation step.

## The argument

If the chart pullback `F` *is* eventually equal to `c := (chartAt ℂ y₀) y₀`
near `z₀ := (chartAt ℂ x) x`, then by ZZ24 (analyticity of chart pullbacks)
combined with `exists_preconnected_open_ball_of_analyticAt` and mathlib's
identity theorem (`AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq`),
`F = c` on a whole preconnected open ball `B ⊆ ℂ` containing `z₀`.

Translated back to `X` via `(chartAt ℂ x).symm`, this says: `f` takes the
constant value `y₀` on a small open neighborhood `(chartAt ℂ x).symm '' B`
of `x` in `X`. (One uses `(chartAt ℂ y₀).left_inv` to pull `c` back to
`y₀`.)

The remaining step — propagating local-constancy on a chart neighborhood
to global-constancy on `X` — is **the path-walking analytic continuation
argument** documented at the bottom of `AnalyticContinuationGlobalization.lean`:

> walking analytic continuation along a path γ : [0,1] → X to chain
> `eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq` across overlapping chart domains,
> using `PathConnectedSpace X` (which follows from `ConnectedSpace +
> LocallyPathConnectedSpace`, the latter true for manifolds).

This is plain analytic-continuation-along-paths; the chart-overlap
analyticity ingredient is in mathlib at the analytic-manifold pin. We
package this propagation step as a single named hypothesis-parameter
`ChartOverlapPropagationHypothesis` and discharge
`ChartPullbackNotEventuallyConstHypothesis` from it.

## What this file delivers

* `ChartOverlapPropagationHypothesis X Y` — single named hypothesis
  capturing the path-walking content: "if `f` is `C^ω` and `f x₀ = y₀` and
  `f` is identically `y₀` on some open neighborhood of `x₀`, then `f` is
  identically `y₀` on all of `X`".

* `chartPullbackNotEventuallyConst_of_chartOverlapPropagation` — discharges
  `ChartPullbackNotEventuallyConstHypothesis X Y` from
  `ChartOverlapPropagationHypothesis X Y`, using ZZ24 + identity theorem.

* End-to-end composition theorems through ZZ38:
  - `chartBallOffCentreWitness_of_chartOverlapPropagation`
  - `perChartNonConstancy_of_chartOverlapPropagation`
  - `withinChartWitness_of_chartOverlapPropagation`
  - `connectivityGlobalization_of_chartOverlapPropagation`
  - `fibres_finite_statement_holds_of_chartOverlapPropagation`

Replacing `ChartPullbackNotEventuallyConstHypothesis` with the strictly
smaller `ChartOverlapPropagationHypothesis` is a clean reduction: the
former mentions `Filter.Eventually`, chart pullbacks, and chart images;
the latter mentions only "constant on an open neighborhood ⇒ constant on
`X`" — a purely topological/analytic-continuation statement with no
filters or chart-coordinate manipulation.

No `sorry`, no `axiom`. -/

/-! ## The chart-overlap propagation hypothesis-parameter -/

/-- **Chart-overlap propagation hypothesis.** For every `C^ω` map
`f : X → Y`, every `y₀ : Y`, every `x₀ : X` with `f x₀ = y₀`, and every
open set `V ⊆ X` containing `x₀` on which `f` is identically `y₀`, the map
`f` is identically `y₀` on all of `X`.

This is the manifold-globalization content owed by the path-walking
analytic-continuation argument. It contains no filter algebra, no chart
coordinates, no eventual equality — purely the topological/analytic
statement "local-constancy at a single point lifts to global-constancy".

The standard proof uses `PathConnectedSpace X` (true for connected
manifolds) and chains `AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq`
across overlapping charts along a path γ from `x₀` to any other point. -/

/-! ## Manifold-side discharge -/

/-- **Discharge of `ChartPullbackNotEventuallyConstHypothesis`.** From the
chart-overlap propagation hypothesis (the path-walking analytic-continuation
step) and the ZZ24 analyticity of chart pullbacks, the chart pullback at
every fibre point of every `y₀` is **not** eventually equal to
`(chartAt ℂ y₀) y₀`.

Argument: if it were, then by ZZ24 + the identity theorem the pullback is
identically `c := (chartAt ℂ y₀) y₀` on a preconnected open ball
`B ⊆ (chartAt ℂ x).target` around `(chartAt ℂ x) x`. Pulling back along
`(chartAt ℂ x)`, this gives an open neighborhood of `x` in `X` on which
the chart-image of `f` is identically `c`. Pulling back further along
`(chartAt ℂ y₀).left_inv`, we get `f ≡ y₀` on that neighborhood. The
chart-overlap propagation hypothesis then upgrades this to `f ≡ y₀` on
all of `X`, contradicting `¬ IsConstantMap f`. -/
