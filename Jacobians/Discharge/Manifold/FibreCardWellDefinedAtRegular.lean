/-! # Composition: Hurwitz local-constancy + preconnected regular subset
⇒ `fibre_card_well_defined_at_regular_statement` (ZZ155, ZZ172-corrected)

Compose ZZ134 (`fibre_card_well_defined_on_regular_subset_holds_of_locallyConstant`)
with a per-`f` packaging of the regular subset `R` and its analytic
locality + topological connectedness, into the named owed statement
`fibre_card_well_defined_at_regular_statement X Y`.

This file is the structural glue. The unconditional discharges of the two
analytic hypotheses (locally-constant ncard on the regular subset, the
chart-pullback-deriv content) plug in via the packaged shape this file
consumes.

Compared with the pre-ZZ172 version, the universally-false `h_C_fin`
hypothesis (which asserted that *every* set in `Y` is finite) is removed.
The corrected witness type `RegularValueWitnessReg f` no longer carries a
`C : Set Y` parameter — its regularity certificate is intrinsic to `f`.

No `sorry`, no `axiom`. -/

/-- **The ZZ155 composition (ZZ172-corrected).** Conditional on a packaged
existence (for every non-constant analytic `f`) of a regular-value subset
`R ⊆ Y` carrying:

* support: every regular witness's value lies in `R`,
* locally-constant ncard on `R` (analytic / covering-space content),
* preconnected `R` (topological content).

Conclude the unfolded form of `fibre_card_well_defined_at_regular_statement X Y`.

Stated in the unfolded `∀ f hf hnc w₁ w₂, w₁.card = w₂.card` shape rather
than against the def, to avoid `intro`-time elaboration "typeclass instance
problem is stuck" issues observed when applying the def directly. The
underlying statement is identical (the def's body). -/
