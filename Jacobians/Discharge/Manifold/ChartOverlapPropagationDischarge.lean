/-! # Discharging chart-overlap propagation from clopen-ness of the locally-constant locus

ZZ43 (`ChartPullbackNotEventuallyConstDischarge.lean`) reduced
`fibres_finite_statement` end-to-end, modulo a single named hypothesis
`ChartOverlapPropagationHypothesis X Y` asserting: for every non-constant
`C^ω` map `f : X → Y`, every `y₀ : Y`, every `x₀ : X` with `f x₀ = y₀`,
and every open `V ∋ x₀` on which `f ≡ y₀`, the map `f` is identically
`y₀` on all of `X`.

This file (ZZ46) reduces that hypothesis to a strictly smaller residual
analytic-continuation statement: **the locally-constant locus is closed**.

## The argument

Define the locally-constant locus
`S := {x | ∀ᶠ x' in 𝓝 x, f x' = y₀}`.

* `S` is **open** by definition of the eventually filter (a point is in
  the interior of `S` because the same neighborhood that witnesses
  `x ∈ S` witnesses every nearby point).

* `S` contains `x₀` (the open `V` from the chart-overlap hypothesis is
  itself a neighborhood of `x₀` on which `f ≡ y₀`).

* `S` is **closed** — this is the residual analytic-continuation
  content, packaged as `ClopennessOfLocallyConstHypothesis`. The
  standard discharge walks a path from `x₀` to a candidate boundary
  point, covers the path with finitely many connected charts, and
  chains `AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq` across
  overlaps to propagate the local constancy. We isolate it as a single
  hypothesis-parameter at this pin.

* `S` clopen + nonempty in a connected space ⇒ `S = univ`. Since
  `x ∈ S` implies `f x = y₀` (the eventually-condition includes the
  point itself via `Filter.Eventually.self_of_nhds`), we conclude
  `f ≡ y₀` on all of `X`.

## What this file delivers

* `ClopennessOfLocallyConstHypothesis X Y` — single named hypothesis
  capturing the residual analytic-continuation content: the
  locally-constant locus of any `C^ω` map onto a fixed value `y₀` is
  closed.

* `chartOverlapPropagation_of_clopennessOfLocallyConst` — discharges
  `ChartOverlapPropagationHypothesis X Y` from
  `ClopennessOfLocallyConstHypothesis X Y` using the connected-clopen
  argument.

* End-to-end composition theorems through ZZ43:
  - `chartPullbackNotEventuallyConst_of_clopennessOfLocallyConst`
  - `chartBallOffCentreWitness_of_clopennessOfLocallyConst`
  - `perChartNonConstancy_of_clopennessOfLocallyConst`
  - `withinChartWitness_of_clopennessOfLocallyConst`
  - `connectivityGlobalization_of_clopennessOfLocallyConst`
  - `fibres_finite_statement_holds_of_clopennessOfLocallyConst`

The reduction `ChartOverlapPropagationHypothesis ⇐
ClopennessOfLocallyConstHypothesis` is clean: the latter mentions only
the topological closedness of a single explicitly-defined set; the
former carries the open-neighborhood data that has to be turned into
constancy. Once the residual closedness is supplied, the connected-
clopen step is plain topology with no chart-coordinate manipulation.

No `sorry`, no `axiom`. -/

/-! ## The clopen-ness hypothesis-parameter -/

/-- **Clopen-ness of the locally-constant locus.** For every `C^ω`
map `f : X → Y` and every `y₀ : Y`, the locally-constant locus
`{x | ∀ᶠ x' in 𝓝 x, f x' = y₀}` is closed.

Combined with the open-ness lemma above, this is the residual
analytic-continuation content owed by the path-walking argument: along
a path `γ : [0,1] → X` from any boundary point of the locus, finitely
many overlapping charts let one chain
`AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq` to extend the
local constancy across the boundary, contradicting boundary-ness.

Isolating only the closedness as a hypothesis lets the connected-clopen
step (open-ness + nonempty + connectedness ⇒ universe) be derived in
plain topology without invoking analyticity. -/

open by definition, closed by the residual hypothesis, contains `x₀`
