/-! # From per-fibre analytic non-degeneracy to discreteness

Companion to `Jacobians.Discharge.Manifold.Degree`. ZZ20 reduced
`Degree.fibres_finite_statement` to the topological hypothesis

```
∀ f y, IsDiscrete (f ⁻¹' {y}).
```

This file gives the next reduction step: it reduces `IsDiscrete` of a fibre
of `f : X → Y` to a hypothesis about chart pullbacks of `f`. Concretely the
deliverable is a chart-pullback driver: given that the chart-pullback
representative of `f` at a point `x ∈ f ⁻¹' {y}` is analytic at the chart
image and is **not** identically equal to the chart image of `y` near it, the
point `x` is isolated in the fibre.

What this file *does* discharge:

* `analyticAt_isolated_zero_of_not_eventually` — pure-ℂ identity-theorem core:
  if `F : ℂ → ℂ` is analytic at `z₀`, takes value `c` at `z₀` and is not
  eventually `c`, then `z₀` is the only zero of `F - c` in some open
  neighbourhood. This is the per-point isolated-zero principle.

* `fiber_pointIsolated_via_chart_pullback` — manifold-side per-point
  consequence: if for every `x ∈ f ⁻¹' {y₀}` there is a chart-trivialised
  neighbourhood of `x` on which the chart-pulled-back `f` is analytic and
  not identically the chart of `y₀`, then `x` is isolated in `f ⁻¹' {y₀}`.
  The "chart trivialisation" is packaged as a homeomorphism between an open
  neighbourhood of `x` and an open subset of `ℂ`, plus a chart for `Y` near
  `y₀`. This avoids `extChartAt`-typeclass elaboration costs and keeps the
  statement self-contained.

* `isDiscrete_fiber_of_chart_pullback` — globalisation in `x`: if the
  chart-pullback non-degeneracy hypothesis holds at every `x ∈ f ⁻¹' {y₀}`,
  then `f ⁻¹' {y₀}` is `IsDiscrete`.

* `fibres_finite_of_chart_pullback` — composition with ZZ20: this discharges
  `Degree.fibres_finite_statement` from the chart-pullback non-degeneracy
  hypothesis.

What this file does **not** do (still open):

* The bridge `ContMDiff 𝓘(ℂ) 𝓘(ℂ) ω f → for each x, the chart pullback of f
  at x is `AnalyticAt`. This is the mathlib bridge from real-analytic
  manifold smoothness to ℂ-analytic chart pullbacks under the model with
  corners `𝓘(ℂ)`. It is left as a hypothesis-parameter on the final
  reduction lemma (no `axiom`, no `sorry`).

* The bridge `¬ IsConstantMap f → for each y, there is some x ∈ f⁻¹' {y}
  with chart pullback not identically equal to chart-of-y near x`. This
  is the standard analytic-continuation step on a connected manifold and is
  also passed as a hypothesis-parameter.

The point of this file: reduce *two* missing classical inputs (chart
analyticity of `ContMDiff … ω`, and analytic-continuation
non-degeneracy on connected manifolds) to a *single* clean condition on
chart pullbacks, and execute the identity-theorem core of the argument
unconditionally on the ℂ-analytic side.

/-! ## Manifold side: per-fiber chart-pullback driver

We package the chart-pullback hypothesis as an explicit data triple at each
fibre point: an open neighbourhood `V ⊆ X`, an open `W ⊆ ℂ`, and a homeo
between them sending `x` to `z₀`, together with the chart pullback being
analytic and the non-degeneracy hypothesis on it. This avoids touching the
`ChartedSpace` typeclass plumbing while staying mathematically faithful. -/

/-- **Chart-pullback isolation data.** For a map `f : X → Y` between
topological spaces, point `x : X` and value `y₀ : Y`, this records a
chart-pullback witness that `x` is isolated in `f ⁻¹' {y₀}`.

* `V` — open neighbourhood of `x` in `X`,
* `chartX : V → ℂ` — homeomorphic image of `V` into ℂ,
* `chartY : Y → ℂ` — a continuous "chart-like" function with `chartY y₀ = c`
  for some constant `c`, and the property that `chartY` separates `y₀`
  from other values *on `f '' V`*: `f x' = y₀ ↔ chartY (f x') = c` for
  `x' ∈ V`.
* `F : ℂ → ℂ` — the chart-pulled-back representation `chartY ∘ f ∘ chartX⁻¹`,
* `hFA` — `F` is analytic at `chartX x`,
* `hFne` — `F` is not eventually equal to `c` near `chartX x`.

We do **not** assume `F z = chartY (f (chartX⁻¹ z))` globally, only that the
zero-set comparison goes through, which is the only thing the proof uses.

Composing `fibres_finite_of_all_fibers_isDiscrete` (ZZ20) with
`isDiscrete_fiber_of_chart_pullback` reduces the full classical
`fibres_finite_statement` to a single clean chart-pullback hypothesis: for
every analytic non-constant `f` and every `y`, every fibre point admits a
`ChartPullbackData` witness.

This is the maximal reduction available without bridging
`ContMDiff … ω → AnalyticAt` on chart pullbacks, which is itself an
unstated mathlib fact at this pin. -/
