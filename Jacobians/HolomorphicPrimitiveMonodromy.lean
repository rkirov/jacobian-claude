# The monodromy theorem (Wall A, step 2 — homotopy invariance of the path value)

The chain-independent path value `pathPrimValue η γ` (the discrete `∫_γ η`) is invariant under
endpoint-fixed homotopies: for a continuous `H : ℝ → ℝ → X` with `H s 0 = x₀`, `H s 1 = x₁`
for all `s`, the value along `H s` is constant in `s`.

Proof: fix `s₀` and a chain for `H s₀`; by compactness ("tube"), for `s` near `s₀` the SAME
partition/primitive data is a chain for `H s` (`IsCompact.eventually_forall_of_forall_eventually`).
Abel summation rewrites the value as boundary terms (fixed, the endpoints are constant in `s`)
minus interior-node terms `(Fₖ − Fₖ₋₁)(H s (tₖ))`, each locally constant in `s` because two
primitives differ by a constant on a path-connected neighbourhood of the node (step-0 rigidity).
So the value is a locally constant function of `s` on ℝ, hence constant.
