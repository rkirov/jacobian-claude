# Compact Liouville for meromorphic functions (non-Dolbeault)

A non-constant meromorphic function on a compact connected Riemann surface must have a pole.
This is the meromorphic corollary of holomorphic Liouville
(`MDifferentiable.exists_eq_const_of_compactSpace`): if `f` had no pole, then in every chart its
order is `≥ 0`, so `f` is (a removable-singularity repair of) a holomorphic function; on a compact
connected manifold that forces it to be constant, whence its order is `≡ 0`, contradicting
non-constancy.

## The removable-singularity repair

`MeromorphicFunction.toFun : X → ℂ` is only pinned up to its germ off each point: at an
isolated removable singularity it may carry an arbitrary "junk" value. Mathlib's order-based limit
theory (`tendsto_nhds_of_meromorphicOrderAt_nonneg`) shows that wherever the order is `≥ 0` the
function has a genuine limit along the punctured neighborhood. We therefore work with the
**limit repair**

  `holoRepr f x := limUnder (𝓝[≠] x) f.toFun`,

which discards the junk: it agrees with the normal-form representative
(`toMeromorphicNFAt`) in every chart, hence is analytic in every chart, hence globally
`MDifferentiable`. No manual gluing of per-chart germs is needed — the single global definition
`holoRepr` is analytic at every point by a per-chart computation.

/-! ### A chart-independent characterization of "order `≥ 0`"

`orderAtPoint f x` is *defined* via the chart `chartAt x`, so comparing it to the order of the
pullback `f.toFun ∘ φ.symm` in a different chart `φ` needs chart-invariance of the order. We avoid
the (currently unproved) `orderAtPoint_chart_invariant` by characterizing nonnegativity of the order
in a manifestly chart-independent way: **`f` has a limit along the punctured neighborhood `𝓝[≠] x`**
(Mathlib `tendsto_nhds_iff_meromorphicOrderAt_nonneg`). Transferring a `Tendsto` statement through a
chart homeomorphism is elementary (`OpenPartialHomeomorph.tendsto_nhdsNE`,
`Jacobians.MeromorphicNFRepair`). -/

/-- The order of `f` at `x` is `≥ 0` iff `f.toFun` has a limit along the punctured neighborhood of
`x` — a manifestly chart-independent statement. -/

/-- **The local repair lemma.** On a small open neighborhood `V` of `φ x₀` (with `φ = chartAt x₀`),
the limit-repair `holoRepr`, read back through the chart, coincides with the normal-form
representative of the pullback `F = f.toFun ∘ φ.symm`. Concretely: for every `w ∈ V`,
`f.holoRepr (φ.symm w) = toMeromorphicNFOn F V w`.

This needs the order of `f` to be `≥ 0` only at `x₀` (the center); at the punctured points `F` is
analytic, so its order is automatically `≥ 0`. -/

the normal form agrees with `F` off the center. This is the punctured-neighborhood input that the
