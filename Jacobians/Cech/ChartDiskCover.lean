  A finite cover whose every set is a coordinate disk — the cover the Dolbeault → Čech forward
  operator (`dolbeaultToCechCocycle`) solves `∂̄` over.

  The abstract `FiniteCover` only knows its sets cover `X`; solving `∂̄u_i = g` on a whole cover set
  `U_i` needs `U_i` to be a *coordinate disk* (so `g` pulls back through the chart to a planar
  function on a Euclidean ball, where `DbarDiskCohomology.dbar_solvable_ball` applies). Solving on
  an abstractly simply-connected `U_i` would instead require uniformization, which Mathlib lacks.

  `ChartDiskCover` bundles a `FiniteCover` with, for each index, a chart center and radius
  witnessing that `U_i` is exactly the chart-preimage of a Euclidean ball. All existing
  `𝔘.cechH1 / cocycles1` machinery applies verbatim through `toFiniteCover`.

/-- A **finite chart-disk cover**: a `FiniteCover` together with, for each index `i`, a chart
`center i` and `radius i` so that `U i` is exactly the chart-preimage of the coordinate ball
`ball (e i) (radius i) ⊆ ℂ` (with `e i = extChartAt 𝓘(ℝ,ℂ) (center i) (center i)` the chart
coordinate of the center). The chart `extChartAt 𝓘(ℝ,ℂ) (center i)` therefore restricts to a
biholomorphism `U i ≃ ball (e i) (radius i)`, which is what lets the forward operator solve `∂̄`
on the whole of `U i` via the planar disk solve. -/

Exists because the closed disk `closedBall (e i) (radius i)` is compact inside the open target
(`IsCompact.exists_cthickening_subset_open` + `cthickening_closedBall`). The forward-solve cutoff
bump uses `rIn = radius i`, `rOut = R`: it is `1` on the whole disk and supported inside the target.
