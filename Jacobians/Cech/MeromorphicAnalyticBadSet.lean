  The product of meromorphic functions, and FINITENESS of the analytic-bad set of a global
  meromorphic function (the points where the chart pullback fails honest `AnalyticAt`).

  ## Why this exists (Miranda Ch. VI pp. 186–188)

  The unconditional 1-form residue theorem `residueTheorem_unconditional`
  consumes a meromorphic numerator `g` through the hypothesis "`g`'s chart pullback is honestly
  `AnalyticAt` at every point off the chosen finite `poles`".  A `MeromorphicFunction` carries
  removable-singularity `toFun`-junk, so this hypothesis is *not* automatic off the genuine poles —
  but the set where it fails IS finite:

  * `MeromorphicFunction.eventually_analyticAt_ownChart` — around every point, a global
    meromorphic function is honestly analytic (in each point's OWN canonical chart) on a punctured
    neighbourhood.  Mathlib's `MeromorphicAt.eventually_analyticAt` gives this in the fixed chart
    at the centre; the repo chart-invariance `analyticAt_chart_change` (`CechH0`) transports it to
    each nearby point's own chart.
  * `MeromorphicFunction.finite_nonAnalyticAt` — hence the bad set is isolated, and on the compact
    `X` it is finite (`finite_of_forall_eventually_nhdsNE_notMem`).

  This is what lets the pair-form residue theorem (`PairFormResidueTheorem`) enlarge its pole
  set by a *finite* bad set before invoking the residue-theorem engine.

  Also here: the pointwise product `f * g` of meromorphic functions (`Mul (MeromorphicFunction X)`),
  which Mathlib's `MeromorphicAt.mul` makes immediate (`Jacobians.Meromorphic.LinearSystem` provides only
  the ℂ-module structure).

/-- **A set avoided by a punctured neighbourhood of every point is finite** (in a compact space).
The indicator of `S` then has locally finite support, and `LocallyFiniteSupport`'s compactness
lemma finishes.  (This is the `exists_form_divisor` finiteness pattern, extracted for sets.) -/

`x`, a global meromorphic function is `AnalyticAt` (junk-free, value included) at every nearby
point `y ≠ x`, read in `y`'s OWN canonical chart.  Mathlib's `MeromorphicAt.eventually_analyticAt`
gives analyticity in the chart at `x`; the chart-transition analyticity
(`Jacobians.Dolbeault.analyticAt_chart_change`) transports it to `y`'s chart. -/
