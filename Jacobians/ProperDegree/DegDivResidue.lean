# Degree-route arithmetic for `deg_div`

Helper lemmas for the residue theorem `MeromorphicFunction.deg_div` (every
principal divisor on a compact Riemann surface has degree `0`, Forster Cor.
4.25), which lives in `Jacobians.RiemannRoch`.

The degree route writes `deg (div f) = zerosCount f - polesCount f` (the pure
`Finset` book-keeping `deg_div_eq_zeros_sub_poles`), where `zerosCount` and
`polesCount` count zeros and poles with multiplicity.  Both equal a common
proper-map degree `d`, so the difference is `0`.  That common-degree fact is the
conservation-of-number theorem `ProperMapDegreeSheets.exists_properMapDegree_proven`
(proven axiom-clean), which consumes the reductions
`exists_properMapDegree_of_zerosCount_eq_polesCount` and
`exists_properMapDegree_of_div_eq_zero` defined here.  This file is complete.

/-! ### The order function on the divisor support

`f.div` is `Finsupp.ofSupportFinite (orderAtPoint f) _`, so its value at `x` is
`orderAtPoint f x` and its degree is `∑_{x ∈ support} orderAtPoint f x`.  We
record the value lemma and the degree-as-support-sum identity. -/

/-! ### Splitting the support sum into zeros and poles

On the support, the order is nonzero, so each point is either a **zero**
(`0 < order`) or a **pole** (`order < 0`).  We split the support sum
accordingly. -/

/-- The support sum splits as the zero-part plus the pole-part. -/

/-! ### Zeros, poles, and the proper-map degree

`zerosCount f` is the number of zeros of `f` counted with multiplicity (the sum
of the *positive* orders), `polesCount f` the number of poles counted with
multiplicity (the sum of the *absolute values* of the negative orders).  Both
are `≥ 0` by construction. -/

/-- The number of **zeros** of `f`, counted with multiplicity: the sum of the
positive orders over the divisor support. -/
def zerosCount (f : MeromorphicFunction X) : ℤ :=
  ∑ x ∈ (f.div : Divisor X).support with 0 < f.orderAtPoint x, f.orderAtPoint x

/-- The number of **poles** of `f`, counted with multiplicity: the sum of the
absolute values of the negative orders over the divisor support. -/
def polesCount (f : MeromorphicFunction X) : ℤ :=
  ∑ x ∈ (f.div : Divisor X).support with f.orderAtPoint x < 0, (-f.orderAtPoint x)

/-- The pole-part of the support sum is `−polesCount`. -/
lemma poles_part_eq_neg_polesCount (f : MeromorphicFunction X) :
    (∑ x ∈ (f.div : Divisor X).support with f.orderAtPoint x < 0, f.orderAtPoint x)

/-- `deg (div f) = zerosCount f − polesCount f`: the divisor degree is the
number of zeros minus the number of poles, each with multiplicity.  This is the
pure book-keeping identity underlying the residue theorem; it is fully proved
(no analytic input). -/

/-! ### Nonnegativity of the two counts, and the reduction to `zerosCount = polesCount`

Both `zerosCount f` and `polesCount f` are sums of *nonnegative* integers (the
positive orders, resp. the absolute values of the negative orders), so both are
`≥ 0`.  Consequently the proper-map-degree existential (a single `d : ℕ`
with `zerosCount f = d = polesCount f`) is **equivalent** to the bare equality
`zerosCount f = polesCount f`: given the equality, both sides are a common
nonnegative integer, which is the cast of some `d : ℕ`.  This isolates the analytic content as the
**argument-principle equality** `zerosCount f = polesCount f`
(Forster Cor. 4.25), stripping away the `∃ d : ℕ` packaging. -/

/-- `zerosCount f ≥ 0`: it is a sum of positive orders. -/

/-- **Reduction to the argument-principle equality.**
Since both counts are nonnegative (`zerosCount_nonneg`, `polesCount_nonneg`), the
existence of a common natural-number degree `d` with `zerosCount f = d` and
`polesCount f = d` is exactly the equality `zerosCount f = polesCount f`.  The
common `d` is the natural number whose cast is the (nonnegative) shared value.

This is the bridge that turns the full analytic content of the residue theorem
into the single classical statement "the number of zeros equals the number of
poles" (the argument principle), with the `∃ d : ℕ` book-keeping discharged. -/

    (h : zerosCount f = polesCount f) :
    ∃ d : ℕ, zerosCount f = (d : ℤ) ∧ polesCount f = (d : ℤ) := by
  obtain ⟨d, hd⟩ := Int.eq_ofNat_of_zero_le (zerosCount_nonneg f)
  exact ⟨d, hd, h ▸ hd⟩

/-- The degree-route conclusion in the trivial case `f.div = 0` (constant or
germ-zero `f`): both counts vanish, witnessed by `d = 0`.  This trivial sub-case *is* provable with
no analytic input — it shows the
isolated statement is a genuine (true) one, not vacuous. -/
