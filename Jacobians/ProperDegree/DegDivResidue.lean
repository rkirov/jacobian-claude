# Degree-route arithmetic for `deg_div`

Helper lemmas for the residue theorem `MeromorphicFunction.deg_div` (every
principal divisor on a compact Riemann surface has degree `0`, Forster Cor.
4.25), which lives in `Jacobians.RiemannRoch`.

The degree route writes `deg (div f) = zerosCount f - polesCount f` (pure
`Finset` book-keeping), where `zerosCount` and `polesCount` count zeros and
poles with multiplicity.  Both equal a common proper-map degree `d`
(conservation of number), so the difference is `0`.

/-! ### The order function on the divisor support

`f.div` is `Finsupp.ofSupportFinite (orderAtPoint f) _`, so its value at `x` is
`orderAtPoint f x` and its degree is `∑_{x ∈ support} orderAtPoint f x`.  We
record the value lemma and the degree-as-support-sum identity. -/

@[simp] lemma div_apply (f : MeromorphicFunction X) (x : X) :

/-! ### Splitting the support sum into zeros and poles

On the support, the order is nonzero, so each point is either a **zero**
(`0 < order`) or a **pole** (`order < 0`).  We split the support sum
accordingly. -/

/-- The support sum splits as the zero-part plus the pole-part. -/

/-! ### Zeros, poles, and the proper-map degree

`zerosCount f` is the number of zeros of `f` counted with multiplicity (the sum
of the *positive* orders), `polesCount f` the number of poles counted with
multiplicity (the sum of the *absolute values* of the negative orders).  Both
are `≥ 0` by construction. -/

positive orders over the divisor support. -/

/-- The number of **poles** of `f`, counted with multiplicity: the sum of the
absolute values of the negative orders over the divisor support. -/
def polesCount (f : MeromorphicFunction X) : ℤ :=
  ∑ x ∈ (f.div : Divisor X).support with f.orderAtPoint x < 0, (-f.orderAtPoint x)

/-- The pole-part of the support sum is `−polesCount`. -/

/-- `deg (div f) = zerosCount f − polesCount f`: the divisor degree is the
number of zeros minus the number of poles, each with multiplicity. -/

/-! ### Nonnegativity of the two counts, and the reduction to `zerosCount = polesCount`

Both `zerosCount f` and `polesCount f` are sums of *nonnegative* integers (the
positive orders, resp. the absolute values of the negative orders), so both are
`≥ 0`.  Consequently the proper-map-degree existential (a single `d : ℕ`
with `zerosCount f = d = polesCount f`) is **equivalent** to the bare equality
`zerosCount f = polesCount f`: given the equality, both sides are a common
nonnegative integer, which is the cast of some `d : ℕ`.  This isolates the analytic content as the
**argument-principle equality** `zerosCount f = polesCount f`
(Forster Cor. 4.25), stripping away the `∃ d : ℕ` packaging. -/

/-- `zerosCount f ≥ 0`: it is a sum of positive orders. -/

  rw [zerosCount]
  apply Finset.sum_nonneg
  intro x hx
  rw [Finset.mem_filter] at hx
  exact hx.2.le

/-- **Reduction to the argument-principle equality.**
Since both counts are nonnegative (`zerosCount_nonneg`, `polesCount_nonneg`), the
existence of a common natural-number degree `d` with `zerosCount f = d` and
`polesCount f = d` is exactly the equality `zerosCount f = polesCount f`.  The
common `d` is the natural number whose cast is the (nonnegative) shared value. -/

    (h : zerosCount f = polesCount f) :
    ∃ d : ℕ, zerosCount f = (d : ℤ) ∧ polesCount f = (d : ℤ) := by
  obtain ⟨d, hd⟩ := Int.eq_ofNat_of_zero_le (zerosCount_nonneg f)
  exact ⟨d, hd, h ▸ hd⟩

/-- The degree-route conclusion in the trivial case `f.div = 0` (constant or
germ-zero `f`): both counts vanish, witnessed by `d = 0`. -/
