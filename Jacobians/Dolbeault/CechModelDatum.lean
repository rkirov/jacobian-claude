  Čech finiteness — the `OverlapChartDatum` for the (4-level) nested chart-cover overlap model.

  Part of discharging `exists_cechModel` (Forster 14.9).
  `CechModelCochain.lean` builds the forward cochain map `OverlapChartDatum.cochainToCcov :
  SectionTuple →ₗ[ℂ] d.Ccov` (germ-class sections ↦ `BddHol` cochains) for ANY `DiskOverlapData d`
  equipped with an `OverlapChartDatum` (per-overlap cover-chart center `chartCenter q`, holomorphy
  domain `V q`, and the nesting witness `closure (d.Uov q) ⊆ chartAt (chartCenter q) '' (V q)`). This
  file supplies that `OverlapChartDatum` for the chart-cover geometry, finishing the forward
  `germ → BddHol` map of the comparison `cechH1 ≃ supH1`.

  THE NESTING PROBLEM (diagnosis).  In `chartCoverOverlapData`, `Uov (a,b) = chartAt y '' (chartOpen a
  ∩ chartOpen b)` is an OPEN set that equals its OWN holomorphy region.  An `OverlapChartDatum` for it
  would need `closure (Uov) ⊆ chartAt y '' V` for some open `V` — forcing `Uov` to be relatively
  compact inside a chart-image, i.e. forcing `closure (chartOpen-overlap) ⊆ V` with `V` open `⊆`
  source.  That cannot hold with `V` the *same* `chartOpen`-overlap.  The fix is a genuinely NESTED
  model: separate the open cover-domain `Uov` (where `BddHol` lives) from a strictly larger open
  holomorphy domain `V` (where the analytic representative is holomorphic), using a level of
  Montel's nested cover in between.

  THE 4-LEVEL MODEL (`nestedChartCoverOverlapData`).  Montel's cover gives, per cover-center `x`, the
  strictly nested chain `innerShrunkChart x ⊆ chartOpen x ⊆ shrunkChart x = closure (chartOpen x) ⊆
  (chartAt x).source` with `innerShrunkChart` (a COMPACT covering family) and `shrunkChart` closed.
  Reading every overlap `(a,b)` in chart `y = coverCenter a`, set:

  * `V (a,b)   = (chartAt y).source ∩ (chartAt (coverCenter b)).source` — the HOLOMORPHY domain (open,
    `⊆ source y`; the analytic representative of an overlap section is holomorphic across both charts'
    sources).
  * `Uov (a,b) = chartAt y '' (chartOpen a ∩ chartOpen b)` — the OPEN cover-domain.  Its closure lands
    inside `chartAt y '' V` because `closure (chartOpen a ∩ chartOpen b) ⊆ shrunkChart a ∩ shrunkChart
    b ⊆ source a ∩ source b = V` (`shrunkChart_subset_source`), so the chart-image of `Uov`'s closure
    is contained in the (compact, hence closed) chart-image of the `shrunkChart`-overlap.
  * `Kov (a,b) = chartAt y '' (innerShrunkChart a ∩ innerShrunkChart b)` — the COMPACT covering
    shrinking, `⊆ Uov` (`innerShrunkChart ⊆ chartOpen`); the `innerShrunkChart` family covers `X`
    (`iUnion_innerShrunkChart_coverCenter_eq`), so this is a genuine Leray-model shrinking, not a
    placeholder.

  The crux nesting witness is `hsub`: `closure (chartAt y '' (chartOpen-overlap)) ⊆ chartAt y ''
  (source-overlap)`, handled by the compact-image / closed-superset argument above
  (`closure_minimal` into the compact `chartAt y '' (shrunkChart-overlap)`).

  Sorry-free; reuses only the axiom-clean Montel nested-cover API (`Jacobians/Montel/Cover.lean`),
  the chart-image atoms (`isOpen/isCompact_chartImage_of_subset_source`, `CechModelGeometry`), and
  standard Mathlib topology (`closure_minimal`, `IsCompact.of_isClosed_subset`,
  `closure_inter_subset_inter_closure`).  Result: `(overlapChartDatum).cochainToCcov` is the finished
  forward `germ → BddHol` cochain map for the model.

/-! ### The (4-level) nested chart-cover overlap data

`chartCoverOverlapData` reads overlaps in the FIRST chart of each ordered pair and takes `Uov` to be
the chart-image of the `chartOpen`-overlap, with `Kov` the chart-image of the (covering) compact
`innerShrunkChart`-overlap.  That model's `Uov` *equals* its own holomorphy region, so it admits no
`OverlapChartDatum`.  `nestedChartCoverOverlapData` keeps the SAME `Uov` and `Kov`, but its
`OverlapChartDatum` reads the holomorphy domain at the strictly larger `source a ∩ source b`, with
`closure (chartOpen-overlap) ⊆ shrunkChart-overlap ⊆ source-overlap` supplying the room. -/

/-- Per-overlap holomorphy domain for the nested model: the intersection of the two cover-charts'
sources, read as an `Opens X`.  Open (intersection of open chart sources), and `⊆ (chartAt
(coverCenter a)).source` so it is a valid `OverlapChartDatum.V`. The analytic representative of an
overlap section is holomorphic on this whole intersection. -/
