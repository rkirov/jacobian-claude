  Dolbeault ladder — discharging `HasChartAnalyticCorrectors 𝔙` for a **shared-chart disk cover**:
  the ball-solve that the `CechDiskAcyclicAssembly` chain reduced germ `H¹(disk, 𝒪) = 0` to.

  `CechDiskAcyclicAssembly` reduced germ-level `H¹(disk, 𝒪) = 0` sorry-free to the single honest
  predicate `HasChartAnalyticCorrectors 𝔙` (ambient chart-analytic correctors `H_i : X → ℂ` whose
  differences split the cocycle's analytic representatives `holoFn (s_{ij})` off a discrete set on
  each overlap), via `cechH1_subsingleton_of_chartAnalyticCorrectors`.  This file PRODUCES
  `HasChartAnalyticCorrectors 𝔙` for a cover all of whose sets live in a single chart `φ = chartAt ℂ c₀`
  and pull back to opens `Ω_i ⊆ ball ⊆ ℂ` covering the ball — STEP C of the obstruction map.

  ## Why PORT, not import the PoU machinery

  The PoU primitives (`cechPoU` / `primFn` / `cechTerm` and the real-smooth bridges
  `contMDiffAt_real_of_chart_analyticAt` / `contMDiffMul_real_complex`) live in
  `DolbeaultComparisonInverse`, but that file defines EIGHT declarations (`holoRep`, `holoFn`,
  `gextLimRep_chart_analyticAt`, …) whose names collide with `CechDiskAcyclicProof`'s re-derivation of
  the same toolkit, so the two cannot be imported together.  We therefore PORT the PoU machinery we
  need into this file (copying the proofs), importing the lighter clash-free `DolbeaultComparison`
  (forms / `proj01L`) rather than `DolbeaultComparisonInverse`, and REUSE by import
  `CechDiskAcyclicProof` (`holoFn` / `toGerm_holoFn` / `chartHoloRep*` / `ballSplit_glued` /
  `dbar_fun_sum`), `DbarDiskCohomology` (`dbar_solvable_ball`), and `ChartDiskCover`.

  NO `sorry` anywhere: everything not sorry-free is a hypothesis predicate or written prose.

/-! ## §3′ — The shared-chart disk family (the inhabitable closed-core base)

A **shared-chart disk family** is a finite family of opens `U_i` all inside a single chart
`φ = chartAt ℂ c₀`, with chart-images `φ '' U_i` in a fixed ball `ball cc r ⊆ ℂ`, carrying a CLOSED
CORE `C ⊆ ⋃ U_i` whose interior contains every overlap.  Every overlap pulls back through the SINGLE
chart `φ` to opens of the ball, so the planar `∂̄`-engine applies and the chart dictionary
(`analyticAt_chart_change`) gives chart-analyticity in each point's own chart.

It is defined HERE (before §0–§2) because the partition of unity, being subordinate to `(U_i)` and
summing to `1` on the closed core `C`, is built FROM this structure (it depends on `C`).  (Previously
the struct lived after §2 and `extended FiniteCover`; the `covers = ⊤` made it uninhabited and the
PoU's `∑ = 1`-on-`X` vacuous — see the struct docstring.) -/

/-- A finite **family** of opens all living in one chart `φ = chartAt ℂ center`, with chart-images in a
fixed ball, TOGETHER WITH a **closed core** `C` on which the partition of unity sums to `1`.

This is the honest, *inhabitable* base for the disk-acyclicity (`extends FiniteFamily`, NOT
`FiniteCover`): a single-chart family cannot cover a compact connected `X`, so the old
`extends FiniteCover` (with `covers : ⨆ Uᵢ = ⊤`) made `SharedChartCover` UNINHABITED and the
disk-acyclicity vacuous.  Re-based to `FiniteFamily`, `cechH1` is the genuine `H¹(disk-region, 𝒪)`.

The **closed core** carries the sum-to-one locus: a partition of unity subordinate to `(Uᵢ)` cannot
sum to `1` on the open `⋃ Uᵢ` (that would force `⋃ Uᵢ` clopen, hence `= X` on connected `X` — exactly
the vacuity).  Instead we ask `∑ ρ = 1` only on the CLOSED `C` (Mathlib's `exists_isSubordinate` takes
a closed `s ⊆ ⋃ Uᵢ`); since every overlap `Uᵢ ⊓ Uⱼ ⊆ interior C`, the germ-splitting the
disk-acyclicity needs holds at every overlap point (where `∑ ρ = 1` on a neighbourhood). -/

/-! ### The un-vacuum witness — `SharedChartCover X` is INHABITED

The single-set chart-ball family witnesses `Nonempty (SharedChartCover X)`.  Pick any `x₀`, let
`φ = chartAt ℂ x₀`, and take the ONE open `U₀ = φ.source ∩ φ⁻¹(ball (φ x₀) r)` (the chart-ball
neighbourhood, where `r > 0` fits inside `φ.target` because the target is open).  Its chart-image lies
in `ball (φ x₀) r` by construction, and it sits in `φ.source`.  The closed core is taken EMPTY
(`core = ∅`): it is trivially closed, `⊆ ⋃ U_i`, and the overlap condition is vacuous (a single index
has no `i ≠ j`).  This makes the structure inhabited WITHOUT the old `covers : ⨆ Uᵢ = ⊤` field — which,
for compact connected `X` and all `Uᵢ` inside one chart, was unsatisfiable (a single chart cannot cover
a compact surface), rendering the whole disk-acyclicity vacuous.  (The empty core is the minimal
witness of inhabitation; a genuine non-trivial core for the analytic content is supplied by the
chart-disk-cover construction the finiteness assembly feeds in.) -/

/-! ## §1 — The per-summand smoothness (fallback rung (b))

For the partition-of-unity globalization we form, on each cover set `U_i`, the primitive
`h_i := ∑_q ρ_q · holoFn (s_{qi})`.  Its `(q)`-summand is `primSummand 𝔙 s q i = rhoC q · holoFn(s_qi)`.
The cocycle component `s_{qi}` is a holomorphic germ on the OVERLAP `U_q ⊓ U_i`, so `holoFn(s_qi)` is
chart-analytic (hence `ContMDiffAt`) only on `U_q ⊓ U_i`.  Subordinateness puts `tsupport ρ_q ⊆ U_q`.

The crucial smoothness fact is therefore the *overlap* statement: `primSummand 𝔙 s q i` is
`ContMDiffAt` at every point of `U_i` (NOT at every point of `X` — at a point of `U_q ∖ U_i` where
`ρ_q ≠ 0` the holomorphic factor is junk).  This is the honest content of the 3-case
`tsupport`/overlap argument (`DolbeaultComparisonInverse.cechTerm`/`primFn`):

  * (a) `x₀ ∈ U_i` and `x₀ ∈ tsupport ρ_q`: then `x₀ ∈ U_q ⊓ U_i` (subordinateness), so both factors
    are smooth at `x₀` (`rhoC` always, `holoFn(s_qi)` by `holoFn_contMDiffAt` on the overlap);
  * (b) `x₀ ∈ U_i` and `x₀ ∉ tsupport ρ_q`: `ρ_q = 0` on a neighbourhood, so the product is locally
    `0`, hence smooth.
  These two opens cover `U_i`.  (The would-be third case `x₀ ∈ U_q ∖ U_i` is exactly the point where
  this object is NOT a global `SmoothCFunctions X` — which is why the construction confines `h_i` to
  `U_i`; see the status note.) -/

(`holoFn_cocycle_sub`) collapses each `q`-bracket to `holoFn(s_{ij})` on `tsupport ρ_q`, and the
weights sum to `1`.  **Diagonal `i = j`:** both sides vanish — the left by `sub_self`, the right by
`holoFn_diag_eq_zero` (`s_{ii} = 0`) — independently of the sum-to-one (the diagonal overlap `U_i` is
not inside the closed core, so the telescoping is NOT available there; the diagonal is handled by

/-! ## §5 — The glued `∂̄`-datum, the ball solve, and the `HasChartAnalyticCorrectors` discharge

The §2 primitive, chart-read `ĥ_i := coverPrim s i ∘ φ.symm`, is `C^∞` on `Ω_i = φ '' U_i` (not on all
of the ball), and `ĥ_j − ĥ_i = holoFn(s_{ij}) ∘ φ.symm` on overlaps (`coverPrim_diff`).  The genuine
ball solve does NOT need ball-wide `ĥ_i`: it solves `∂̄u = ω̂` for ONE global glued datum `ω̂` on the
ball (`DbarDiskCohomology.dbar_solvable_ball`) and sets `η̂_i := ĥ_i − u` on `Ω_i ∩ ball`; then
`∂̄η̂_i = ∂̄ĥ_i − ω̂ = 0` (so `η̂_i` is holomorphic) and `η̂_j − η̂_i = ĥ_j − ĥ_i` is unchanged.

So the SINGLE remaining analytic obligation is the **global glued `∂̄`-datum** `ω̂ : ℂ → ℂ`: globally
`C^∞`, agreeing with `∂̄ĥ_i` on each `Ω_i ∩ ball`.  Mathematically `ω̂` is the chart-pushforward of the
Bott–Tu double sum `∑_{q,k}(ρ_q·holoFn(s_{qk}))·∂̄ρ_k` — globally `C^∞` because each term carries the
confining factor `∂̄ρ_k` (the 3-case `tsupport` argument of `DolbeaultComparisonInverse.cechTerm`).
This is the documented OBSTRUCTION-3 globalization; it is isolated below as the predicate
`HasGluedDbarDatum` — never a `sorry`.  Everything downstream (the ball solve, holomorphy of `η̂_i`,
chart-analyticity of `H_i := η̂_i ∘ φ`, and the difference identity) is discharged sorry-free here. -/

`η̂_i` is holomorphic there (`∂̄η̂_i = ∂̄ĥ_i − ω̂ = 0`, `differentiableAt_of_dbar_eq_zero`), so
`H_i := η̂_i ∘ φ` is chart-analytic on `U_i` (`analyticAt_compChart_of_differentiableOn`), and the

/-! ## Status and the EXACT remaining goal

WHAT IS DELIVERED HERE (all sorry-free; axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`):

  * **§0 — Ported PoU machinery (fallback rung (a)):** `ofRealCM`, `coverPoU` / `coverPoU_subordinate`
    (the subordinate smooth partition of unity over a generic `FiniteCover`), `rhoC` / `sum_rhoC` /
    `sum_rhoC_apply` / `rhoC_eq_zero_of_notMem`, the real-smooth bridge
    `contMDiffAt_real_of_chart_analyticAt`, and the ring instance `contMDiffMul_real_complex` — all
    ported (proofs copied) from `DolbeaultComparisonInverse`, which is UN-IMPORTABLE here (it
    re-derives, under the same names, the `holoRep`/`holoFn`/… toolkit that the imported
    `CechDiskAcyclicProof` also derives — eight name clashes in `Jacobians.Dolbeault`).  The lighter
    `DolbeaultComparison` is imported (clash-free).  Plus the `holoFn` algebra ports `Gext_sub` /
    `holoFn_tendsto` / `holoFn_sub` / `holoFn_congr` / `holoFn_restrict` and the cocycle-value relation
    `holoFn_cocycle_sub` (`s_{qj} − s_{qi} = s_{ij}` on triple overlaps, from `δ¹s = 0`).

  * **§1 — Per-summand overlap smoothness (fallback rung (b)):** `contMDiffAt_primSummand` — the
    summand `ρ_q · holoFn(s_{qi})` is `ContMDiffAt 𝓘(ℝ,ℂ)` at every point of `U_i`, by the two-case
    `tsupport`/overlap argument (on `tsupport ρ_q ⊆ U_q` the point lies in `U_q ⊓ U_i`, off it `ρ_q`
    vanishes).  This is the honest function-level content of `DolbeaultComparisonInverse.cechTerm` /
    `primFn` (the load-bearing piece the task flagged).  NOTE — the genuine reason `h_i` is confined to
    `U_i`: at a point of `U_q ∖ U_i` with `ρ_q ≠ 0` the holomorphic factor is junk, so the summand is
    NOT globally `C^∞` on `X`.  The construction (and Forster) therefore work on `U_i`, never on all of
    `X`/the ball.

  * **§2 — The cover-set primitive (fallback rung (c), manifold side):** `coverPrim 𝔙 s i =
    ∑_q ρ_q · holoFn(s_{qi})`, `ContMDiffAt` on `U_i` (`contMDiffAt_coverPrim`), with the TELESCOPING
    DIFFERENCE IDENTITY `coverPrim_diff`: `coverPrim s j − coverPrim s i = holoFn(s_{ij})` on `U_i ⊓ U_j`
    (the cocycle relation `holoFn_cocycle_sub` collapses each `q`-bracket, `∑ρ = 1` finishes).

  * **§3 — The shared-chart disk cover + chart pushforward:** `SharedChartCover` (a `FiniteCover` all of
    whose sets sit in one chart `φ = chartAt ℂ center` with chart-images in a fixed ball — the geometric
    situation STEP C runs over), `Ω`/`isOpen_Ω`, and `contDiffAt_coverPrim_chart` (the chart-read
    `coverPrim s i ∘ φ.symm` is `ContDiffAt ℝ ⊤` on `Ω_i`).

  * **§4 — Chart-analyticity of `H_i = η̂_i ∘ φ`:** `analyticAt_compChart_of_differentiableOn` — a
    holomorphic chart corrector `η̂_i` on `ball ∩ Ω_i` gives `H_i := η̂_i ∘ φ` chart-analytic on `U_i`
    (`η̂_i` analytic at `φ y`, `H_i ∘ φ.symm = η̂_i` there, then `analyticAt_chart_change` to `y`'s own
    chart).

  * **§5 — The glued `∂̄`-datum reduction (fallback rung (d), discharge):** the SORRY-FREE chain
    `HasGluedDbarDatum ⟹ HasChartAnalyticCorrectors ⟹ (H¹(disk, 𝒪) = 0)`:
    - `differentiableAt_of_dbar_eq_zero_local` (local Wirtinger, since `chartPrim` is only `ContDiffAt`);
    - `chartPrim` (the chart-read primitive) + `chartPrim_diff` (its overlap difference is the
      chart-pushed `holoFn(s_{ij})`, witnessing `HasGluedDbarDatum` is non-degenerate);
    - `hasChartAnalyticCorrectors_of_hasGluedDbarDatum`: solve `∂̄u = ω̂` on the ball
      (`DbarDiskCohomology.dbar_solvable_ball`), set `η̂_i := chartPrim s i − u` (holomorphic on
      `ball ∩ Ω_i` by the local Wirtinger lemma), `H_i := η̂_i ∘ φ` (chart-analytic by §4), differences
      split `holoFn(s_{ij})` by `coverPrim_diff`;
    - `cechH1_subsingleton_of_hasGluedDbarDatum`: the end-to-end germ-level collapse via the imported
      `cechH1_subsingleton_of_chartAnalyticCorrectors`.

IMPORT FINDING (corrects/confirms the task premise).  Importing `CechDiskAcyclicAssembly` +
`CechDiskAcyclicProof` (transitive) together with `DolbeaultComparison` + `DbarDiskCohomology` +
`ChartDiskCover` compiles cleanly — NO `NormedAddCommGroup (ℂ →L[ℝ] ℂ)` diamond and NO name clash (the
clash is ONLY against `DolbeaultComparisonInverse`, which is correctly avoided by porting).

THE EXACT REMAINING GOAL — `HasGluedDbarDatum 𝔇`: produce, for each cocycle `s`, a single
globally-`C^∞` function `ω̂ : ℂ → ℂ` agreeing with `∂̄(coverPrim s i ∘ φ.symm)` on each `Ω_i ∩ ball`.
This is the chart-pushforward of the Bott–Tu **double-sum** glued `∂̄`-datum
`∑_{q,k}(ρ_q · holoFn(s_{qk})) · ∂̄ρ_k` — globally `C^∞` because each term carries the CONFINING factor
`∂̄ρ_k` (supported in `U_k`), so the documented 3-case `tsupport` argument of
`DolbeaultComparisonInverse.cechTerm` makes the whole double sum globally smooth and `i`-independent.
(`chartPrim_diff` shows the per-`i` data are consistent: the `∂̄ĥ_i` are forced to agree on overlaps.)
This is the single OBSTRUCTION-3 PoU globalization that "reduced-but-didn't-close" twice; it is the only
remaining gap, written as the predicate `HasGluedDbarDatum`, NEVER a `sorry`.  Producing `ω̂` requires
PORTING the double-sum `cechTerm` analytic content into the chart-function setting (the documented
~400-LoC step), and — combined with the §0–§5 chain above — discharges `HasGluedDbarDatum`, hence
`HasChartAnalyticCorrectors`, hence germ-level `H¹(disk, 𝒪) = 0`, for a shared-chart disk cover.
