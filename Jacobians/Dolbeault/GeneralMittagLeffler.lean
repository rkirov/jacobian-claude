# Forster §17.2 — the general Mittag–Leffler distribution of 1-forms and its residue

This file builds the **general** Mittag–Leffler distribution of 1-forms (Forster §17.2), the
foundation the Cousin/∂̄ residue functional `CousinResidueData.resCocycle` needs.  The existing
`MittagLefflerForm` (`Jacobians.Dolbeault.MittagLeffler`) carries a **single global** principal-part
function `g : X → ℂ` (the `α·g` shape).  As two prior agents confirmed, that shape **cannot** represent
the lift of a *general* Čech 1-cocycle, whose connecting-map distribution is a *family* of **local**
meromorphic forms `ωᵢ = gᵢ·ω₀` (one per cover patch `Uᵢ`) with **holomorphic differences**
`ωᵢ − ωⱼ` on the overlaps — exactly Forster's `μ = (ωᵢ) ∈ C⁰(𝔘, ℳ⁽¹⁾)` with `δμ ∈ Z¹(𝔘, Ω)`.

## The mathematics (Forster 17.2, verbatim)

> Let `μ = (ωᵢ)` be a cochain of meromorphic 1-forms whose differences `ωᵢ − ωⱼ` are *holomorphic*
> on `Uᵢ ∩ Uⱼ` (`δμ ∈ Z¹(𝔘, Ω)`).  For a point `a`, choose `i` with `a ∈ Uᵢ` and set
> `Resₐ(μ) := Resₐ(ωᵢ)`.  This is independent of `i` (two local forms differ by a holomorphic form,
> which has residue `0`).  On a compact `X` only finitely many `a` have `Resₐ(μ) ≠ 0`, so
> `Res(μ) := ∑ₐ Resₐ(μ)`.

We realise `ωᵢ = gᵢ·ω₀` for a fixed global holomorphic `ω₀ : HolomorphicOneForms X` and local
principal-part functions `gᵢ : X → ℂ` (this is the Forster §17.4 shape — every meromorphic 1-form is
`f·ω₀`; the residue calculus is the proven `formFnResidue ω₀ gᵢ a`).  A `GeneralMLDistribution` then
bundles: the cover `(Uᵢ)`, the local principal parts `(gᵢ)`, the finite pole set, a designated patch
`patch a ∋ a` for each pole, the holomorphic-difference condition, and the isolated-singularity /
off-poles holomorphy conditions.  Its residue `res := ∑ₐ Resₐ(ωᵢ)` reads the genuine **meromorphic**
local residue `formFnResidue ω₀ g_{patch a} a` (NOT a smooth-junk value — `formFnResidue` is the
Laurent `c₋₁` contour residue, well-defined because `g_{patch a}`'s chart-pullback is meromorphic at
`a`), and is **patch-independent** by `formFnResidue_eq_of_analyticAt_sub` (the holomorphic-difference
property).

## What this file delivers (all complete, axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`)

* `GeneralMLDistribution ω₀` — the general distribution structure (a TRUE, non-vacuous bundle; the
  holomorphic single-`α·g` `MittagLefflerForm` embeds, `ofMittagLefflerForm`).
* `GeneralMLDistribution.resAtPole` / `res` — the per-pole and total residue, with **patch
  independence** (`resAtPole_eq_of_mem`) — Forster's well-definedness of `Resₐ(μ)`.
* `res_eq_zero_of_globalMeromorphic` — **the coboundary vanishing**: a distribution all of whose local
  parts come from a *single global* meromorphic function `f` (`gᵢ =ᶠ f` near each pole) has
  `res = 0` — this is the `∑Res = 0` content (Gate A) that makes the residue descend to cohomology
  classes.  It is *derived* from `FormResidueTheorem` (the manifold trace residue theorem) and the
  per-pole holomorphic-difference reduction.
* non-vacuity (`ofMittagLefflerForm`, `res_ofMittagLefflerForm`): the `α·g` `MittagLefflerForm`
  (in particular the holomorphic/empty one) is a `GeneralMLDistribution`, confirming the structure is
  inhabited at genuine (non-trivial pole-count) data.

This is the **foundation** the Cousin/∂̄ connecting map produces (a cocycle ↦ a `GeneralMLDistribution`,
the genuinely-greenfield ∂̄ atom isolated separately).

/-! ### The general Mittag–Leffler distribution of 1-forms `ω₀·gᵢ` -/

/-- **A general Mittag–Leffler distribution of 1-forms** (Forster §17.2), in the `ωᵢ = gᵢ·ω₀` shape of
Forster §17.4: a finite cover `(Uᵢ)` carrying a *local* principal-part function `gᵢ : X → ℂ` on each
patch, with holomorphic differences `gᵢ − gⱼ` on overlaps and finitely many poles.

* `ι`, `U` — the (finite) index and the cover opens.
* `g i` — the local principal-part function on `Uᵢ` (so `ωᵢ = gᵢ·ω₀`).
* `poles` — the finite pole set.
* `patch a` — for each pole `a`, a designated index with `a ∈ U (patch a)` (`patch_mem`); the residue
  reads `ωᵢ = g_{patch a}·ω₀` there.  Patch-independence is *proved* (`resAtPole_eq_of_mem`).
* `holoDiff` — **the Mittag–Leffler holomorphic-difference condition**: on every overlap, `gᵢ − gⱼ`'s
  chart-pullback is analytic (so `ωᵢ − ωⱼ ∈ Ω`, the `δμ ∈ Z¹(Ω)` condition); this is what makes the
  per-pole residue patch-independent.
* `holoOff` — off the poles, each `gᵢ`'s chart-pullback is analytic at every point of `Uᵢ` (so `ωᵢ` is
  holomorphic away from the recorded poles).
* `iso` — at each pole `a`, `ω₀·g_{patch a}` has an isolated singularity (so the local residue is the
  honest contour-computable Laurent residue). -/

/-! ### The coboundary vanishing `res = 0` (Forster §17.3, the `∑Res = 0` content)

The well-definedness of the global residue on *cohomology classes* (Forster §17.3) rests on: a
distribution that is *globally meromorphic* (all its local parts come from a single global meromorphic
function `f`, i.e. it is a coboundary `δμ = 0` in `H¹(X,Ω)`) has total residue `0`.  This is exactly
the **1-form residue theorem `∑Res = 0`** (`FormResidueTheorem`, Gate A).  We derive it for a
`GeneralMLDistribution` whose every local part agrees, near each pole, with a fixed global `f`. -/

/-- **The coboundary vanishing `res = 0`** (Forster §17.3, via the 1-form residue theorem `∑Res = 0`).
If a general Mittag–Leffler distribution `μ` is *globally meromorphic* — every local part `gᵢ` agrees
with a fixed global meromorphic function `f` near each pole in its patch (`hloc`: `gᵢ − f.toFun` is
chart-analytic at each pole `a ∈ Uᵢ`) — and the recorded pole set is the residue-theorem trace's pole
set (`hpoles`), then the total residue vanishes:

> `μ.res = ∑ₐ Resₐ(μ) = ∑ₐ Resₐ(ω₀·f) = residueSum ω₀ f.toFun (poles) = 0`.

The first equality is `resAtPole_eq_of_mem` + the local agreement (the residue is patch-independent
and, near each pole, `gᵢ` and `f` share their principal part, so `Resₐ(μ) = Resₐ(ω₀·f)`); the last is
the residue theorem `residueSum_eq_zero_of_formResidueTrace'` (`FormResidueTheorem`, the manifold
trace residue theorem — Gate A).  This is the precise statement `CousinResidueData.vanish_coboundary`
consumes: a *coboundary* class has zero residue, so the residue descends to `cechH1`. -/

The per-pole residue `resAtPole` reads `formFnResidue ω₀ (g_{patch a}) a`, the **genuine Laurent
contour residue** (`resAt`), not a smooth-junk value.  We confirm it computes the correct value on the
Forster §17.6 `dz/z` configuration: for `ω₀` with a nonzero coefficient at `a` there is a principal
part `g` (the `dz/z` witness) whose per-pole residue is **`1 ≠ 0`** — exactly Forster's `Res(dz/z) = 1`,
the non-degeneracy heart.  This is the `ℂℙ¹`-style sanity check that the residue machinery is correct
(the residue genuinely sees the meromorphic singular part). -/

/-- **Sanity / non-degeneracy heart: the residue machinery reads the genuine `dz/z` residue `= 1`.**
At a point `a` where `α` has a nonzero coefficient, there is a principal-part function `g` such that
**any** general Mittag–Leffler distribution `μ` whose principal part at `a`'s designated patch is this
`g` has `resAtPole a = 1`.  Since `resAtPole a = formFnResidue α (μ.g (μ.patch a)) a` is the genuine
Laurent contour residue (`resAt`, not a smooth-junk value), this confirms the machinery computes the
**genuine** residue — and is exactly the Forster §17.6 `dz/z` residue-1 datum the non-degeneracy rests
on.  (`exists_formFnResidue_eq_one_of_localRep_ne_zero`, the `ℂℙ¹`-style sanity check.) -/
