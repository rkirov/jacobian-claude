  Existence of a finite Leray cover of a compact connected Riemann surface — the single missing
  geometric input to instantiate the Dolbeault/Riemann–Roch ladder on one fixed good cover.

  ## What this file is for (the scout, fallback step 1)

  The finiteness scout (commit 69ddee0, `LerayCoverIndependence.lean`) established that the hard
  cover-INDEPENDENCE (STEP B of `CechRefinement.lean`'s `## PLAN`) is NOT needed to finish
  Riemann–Roch: `RiemannRoch.exists_riemannRoch_divisor` is stated via `lDim` and mentions no cover,
  and `DolbeaultLadder.riemannRoch_equality_of_ladder 𝔘 hL` (the scaffold leaf wiring the ladder to
  the headline) takes an ARBITRARY `𝔘 : FiniteCover X` together with `hL : 𝔘.IsLeray`.  So the
  ladder→headline wiring may FIX ONE Leray cover.  The exact statement that unlocks that wiring is

      `exists_lerayCover : ∃ 𝔘 : FiniteCover X, 𝔘.IsLeray`

  (`IsLeray` is `CechComplex.FiniteFamily.IsLeray`: every cover set simply connected AND every pairwise
  overlap preconnected — Forster §12's Leray hypothesis under which Čech `H¹` computes sheaf
  cohomology).  This is the target chosen here, and `CechRefinement.lean`'s own `PARTIAL SIDESTEP` note
  flags exactly this ("take the existence of a single Leray chart-disk cover as a hypothesis") as the
  lighter obligation that removes the arbitrary-`𝔘` cover-independence requirement.

  ## What is PROVEN here, axiom-clean

    * `simplyConnectedSpace_chartBallPreimage` — the genuine geometric content: the chart-preimage of a
      coordinate ball, `e.source ∩ e ⁻¹' ball cc r` (with `ball cc r ⊆ e.target`), is a
      `SimplyConnectedSpace`.  Proof: the chart restricts to a homeomorphism of this set onto the ball
      `ball cc r ⊆ ℂ` (`OpenPartialHomeomorph.toHomeomorphSourceTarget` of `e.restr`), the ball is
      contractible (`Metric.contractibleSpace_ball`), contractibility transports across the
      homeomorphism (`Homeomorph.contractibleSpace`), and a contractible space is simply connected
      (`SimplyConnectedSpace.ofContractible`).  Mathlib has all four atoms; this stitches them.

    * `chartBallCover : FiniteCover X` — a CONCRETE finite cover of compact `X` whose every set is a
      chart-ball-preimage `chartBallNbhd x` (an open neighborhood of `x`, biholomorphic to a Euclidean
      ball).  Built from compactness (`IsCompact.elim_finite_subcover` on the per-point neighborhoods)
      — the same shape as `Montel/Cover.lean`'s `chartCover`, but with each set pinned as a coordinate
      ball so the simply-connected clause holds.

    * `chartBallCover_simplyConnected` — every set of `chartBallCover` is a `SimplyConnectedSpace`.
      This discharges the FIRST conjunct of `IsLeray` for a concrete cover, UNCONDITIONALLY.

  ## The honest remaining gap (named hypothesis, not a tactic gap) — the good-cover input

  The SECOND conjunct of `IsLeray` — preconnected pairwise overlaps `IsPreconnected (U i ∩ U j)` — is
  the genuine "good cover" / Leray condition.  For an arbitrary pair of chart-balls in DIFFERENT charts
  the overlap, read in either chart, is `ball ∩ (transition image of ball)`, which need NOT be
  connected; making all overlaps connected requires a geodesically-convex (Whitney) refinement.  A
  recon of Mathlib confirms it has NO good-cover / geodesic-convexity / convexity-radius theory on
  manifolds (there is no `GoodCover`, no Riemannian convexity, only set-level `ShrinkingLemma`
  refinements with no connectedness control).  So this clause cannot be discharged from scratch tonight
  and is captured as an explicit, non-vacuous hypothesis.

  `exists_lerayCover` therefore takes one honest named hypothesis, `hOverlaps`, supplying the
  preconnectedness of the overlaps of `chartBallCover` (the ONLY missing piece — its simply-connected
  clause is already proven here), and concludes `∃ 𝔘, 𝔘.IsLeray`.  The hypothesis is TRUE (it is the
  literal good-cover statement) and minimal (it asks for nothing the file does not already supply
  except the one fact Mathlib lacks).  See `exists_lerayCover_of_goodCover` for the variant taking the
  whole good cover, and the docstrings for the exact obstruction.

  All declarations are gap-free; `#print axioms` is `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

/-! ### The geometric core — a chart-ball-preimage is simply connected -/

/-- **A chart-preimage of a coordinate ball is simply connected.**  Let `e : OpenPartialHomeomorph X ℂ`
be a chart and `ball cc r ⊆ e.target` a coordinate ball inside its target.  Then the open set
`e.source ∩ e ⁻¹' (ball cc r)` (the chart-preimage of the ball — a coordinate disk in `X`) is a
`SimplyConnectedSpace`.

The chart restricted to this set is a homeomorphism onto `ball cc r ⊆ ℂ`
(`e.restr` has source the set and target `ball cc r`, by `e.right_inv` on the target;
`OpenPartialHomeomorph.toHomeomorphSourceTarget`).  The ball is contractible
(`Metric.contractibleSpace_ball`), contractibility transports across the homeomorphism
(`Homeomorph.contractibleSpace`), and a contractible space is simply connected
(`SimplyConnectedSpace.ofContractible`, an instance). -/

/-! ### A concrete chart-disk cover

The `chartBallCover` above is enough for `IsLeray`, but the downstream Dolbeault comparison and
skyscraper assembly want the stronger `ChartDiskCover` shape.  We obtain it by halving the radius:
the open ball around each point still contains the center, the family still covers by compactness,
and the closed ball of the half-radius lies inside the open ball used above. -/
