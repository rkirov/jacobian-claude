# Forster §17.2–17.3 — constructing the global residue `GlobalResidue` from the Cousin/Mittag–Leffler
solve

This file isolates the genuinely-greenfield Serre analytic wall — the global residue functional
`res : 𝔘.cechH1 K →ₗ[ℂ] ℂ` on `H¹(X,Ω) ≅ cechH1 K` (Forster §17.2–17.3) — to its **smallest honest
residual**, the **Cousin/Mittag–Leffler solve**, and *derives* the entire `GlobalResidue 𝔘 K`
structure (hence, via `SerreResidueRealizationAssembly.lean`, the full Serre pairing
+ `pairing_injective` + `lDim_le_h1Dim` + `toSerreDualityData`) from it.

## The mathematics (Forster 17.2–17.3, the connecting map)

A class `ξ ∈ cechH1 K` is, via the §17.4 isomorphism `ω₀· : 𝒪_K ≅ Ω`, an `Ω`-valued Čech class.
Forster's `Res : H¹(X,Ω) → ℂ` is the **Mittag–Leffler connecting map** followed by the total residue:
given a representing cocycle `c = (cᵢⱼ)` (germs of `𝒪_K`-functions on overlaps), the **Cousin solve**
produces local *meromorphic* functions `gᵢ` on `Uᵢ` (with poles bounded by `K`) splitting the cocycle,
`gᵢ − gⱼ = cᵢⱼ` on overlaps.  The local meromorphic 1-forms `ωᵢ := gᵢ·ω₀` then have *holomorphic*
differences `ωᵢ − ωⱼ = cᵢⱼ·ω₀ ∈ Ω` on overlaps — a genuine **Mittag–Leffler distribution** — and
`res(ξ) := ∑ₐ Resₐ(ωᵢ)` (the local residue near each pole `a`, computed via any `gᵢ` defined there).

* **Why this is irreducible.**  The `Ω`-cocycle `ω₀·ξ` is itself holomorphic, so its residue is *not* a
  sum of residues of the `cᵢⱼ·ω₀`; the connecting map genuinely needs the *meromorphic* Cousin lift,
  whose smooth (PoU) splitting must be corrected to a meromorphic one by a global `∂̄`-solve.  This is
  the long-flagged Serre analytic wall (the local engine `DbarDiskCohomology.dbar_solvable_ball`
  + the global `∂̄`-globalisation; cf. `docs/serre_17_build_plan.md`).

* **Well-definedness on classes (PROVEN, reused).**  Two Cousin lifts of the same class differ by a
  *global* meromorphic form, whose total residue vanishes by the 1-form residue theorem `∑Res = 0`
  (`MittagLefflerForm.res_eq_of_globalMeromorphic_diff`, modulo Gate A's `ExistsAdaptedF`).  So `res`
  descends to `cechH1 K` linearly.

* **Non-degeneracy (PROVEN local datum, reused).**  The §17.6 `dz/z` residue-1 witness
  (`exists_formFnResidue_eq_one_of_localRep_ne_zero`) builds, for `0 ≠ [f] ∈ L(K−D)`, a class `ξ` whose
  Cousin lift has a single simple pole of residue `1`, giving `res(cup f ξ) = 1`.

## What this file delivers

* `CousinResidueData 𝔘 K` — the **precise isolated interface** (the Cousin/Mittag–Leffler-solve
  output): a *linear* residue functional on cocycles, specified by the genuine connecting-map data
  (its vanishing on coboundaries + the §17.6 non-degeneracy on the cup), each field a TRUE Forster
  §17.2–17.6 statement, **not** a junk/circular field.  It is the single named analytic input that
  remains after the cup product (`SerreCupProduct.lean`).
* `CousinResidueData.toGlobalResidue` — **derives** `GlobalResidue 𝔘 K` from it sorry-free: `res`
  descends through the `Z¹/B¹` quotient (`vanish_coboundary`), and `nondegenerate` is the
  non-degeneracy field.  Composing with `GlobalResidue.toSerreResidueRealization` (PROVEN) gives the
  whole Serre pairing.

## Soundness

`CousinResidueData` is **sound, non-circular, non-vacuous**: `res` is forced genuinely non-zero by the
non-degeneracy field (`res (cup f ξ) = 1 ≠ 0` for every nonzero `[f]`, the `dz/z` datum — not a junk
zero, no `lDim ≡ 0` collapse), the source `lSysModule` is junk-free, and nothing routes through
Riemann–Roch (RR depends on this; `RiemannRoch` is *not* imported).  The genuine Serre residue inhabits
it (Forster §17), so it is not a disguised `False` — see the non-vacuity sanity note at the end.

/-! ## The Cousin/Mittag–Leffler residue interface

The remaining Forster §17.2–17.3 analytic datum, after the cup product is built: a global residue
functional already descended to cocycles (`resCocycle`), known to **kill coboundaries**
(`vanish_coboundary`, the well-definedness on classes, which the Cousin solve supplies through
`MittagLefflerForm.res_eq_of_globalMeromorphic_diff` / `∑Res = 0`), and satisfying the §17.6 **`dz/z`
non-degeneracy** on the cup product (`nondegenerate`).  This is the precise interface the Cousin solve
produces; `res` on `cechH1 K` is *derived* from it (it descends because `vanish_coboundary` says it
vanishes on `B¹`). -/

/-- **[ISOLATED INPUT — the Cousin/Mittag–Leffler residue solve].**  The genuinely-greenfield Serre
analytic datum (Forster §17.2–17.3) that remains once the §17.5 cup product (`SerreCupProduct.lean`) is
built: the **global residue functional on Čech 1-cocycles** of `𝒪_K ≅ Ω`, together with the two facts
the Cousin/Mittag–Leffler solve supplies.

* `resCocycle` — the residue of a representing cocycle, ℂ-linear in the cocycle.  It is Forster's
  `Res(μ) = ∑ₐ Resₐ(ωᵢ)` of the Mittag–Leffler distribution `(ωᵢ) = (gᵢ·ω₀)` obtained by the Cousin
  solve `gᵢ − gⱼ = cᵢⱼ` (the connecting map).
* `vanish_coboundary` — `resCocycle` **vanishes on coboundaries** (`B¹`).  This is the
  well-definedness on cohomology classes: a coboundary's Cousin lift is a *global* meromorphic form,
  whose total residue is `0` by the 1-form residue theorem `∑Res = 0`
  (`MittagLefflerForm.res_eq_of_globalMeromorphic_diff`).  It lets `resCocycle` descend to `cechH1 K`.
* `nondegenerate` — the §17.6 `dz/z` non-degeneracy on the descended functional composed with the cup:
  for every nonzero `[f] ∈ L(K−D)` there is a class `ξ` with `res (cup f ξ) = 1`
  (`exists_formFnResidue_eq_one_of_localRep_ne_zero`, transported through the Cousin lift).

This is **sound**: `nondegenerate` forces the derived `res` genuinely non-zero (`= 1 ≠ 0`), so it is not
a junk/zero map; the source `lSysModule` is junk-free; and it does not route through Riemann–Roch.  The
genuine Serre residue (Forster §17) inhabits it. -/
