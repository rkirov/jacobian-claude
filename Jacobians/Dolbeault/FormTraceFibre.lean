# The per-fibre trace data of `α = ω₀·g` (Gate A, node A-ii — bridges (a)/(b)/(c))

This file builds the **per-fibre** geometric content of the general 1-form residue theorem: the
construction of a `Jacobians.MeromorphicTrace.FibreTrace` over an *unramified* fibre `f⁻¹(b)` of the
cover `F = f.toRiemannSphere`, and the **per-fibre residue bridge**

> `resAt (T.coeff i) (T.pre i) = formFnResidue ω₀ g (xs i)`   (definitional, bridge (c)),

so that Miranda's Lemma 3.2 (`FibreTrace.resAt_traceCoeff'`, the now-unconditional residue
change-of-variables) gives

> `Res_b (Tr_F α over the fibre) = ∑_{x ∈ f⁻¹(b)} Res_x(α)`.

This is the genuinely-new **manifold-bundle** layer that feeds the `FormResidueTrace` assembly
(`Jacobians.Dolbeault.FormResidueTheorem`).  The remaining piece *after* this file — the global
**rationality** of the trace `Tr_F α` on `ℂℙ¹` (assembling the per-fibre data over *all* fibres into
a single `LaurentForm`) — is the last obligation, diagnosed precisely at the bottom of this file.

## The design — `coeff i`/`pre i` chosen to make bridge (c) definitional

The crucial design decision (mirroring the close-path's A-ii analysis): a `FibreTrace` over `b` with
sheets indexed by the fibre points `xs : ι → X` uses
* `pre i := (chartAt ℂ (xs i)) (xs i)` — the source-chart coordinate of `xs i`;
* `coeff i := fun w => coeffAt ω₀ (xs i) w * g ((chartAt ℂ (xs i)).symm w)` — the **chart integrand
  of `α = ω₀·g`** at `xs i`, exactly the function whose `resAt` at `pre i` is `formFnResidue ω₀ g
  (xs i)` *by definition* (`Jacobians.Dolbeault.formFnResidue`).

With this choice the per-fibre residue bridge (c) is **definitional** (`resAt_coeff_eq_formFnResidue`),
and the only genuinely-analytic inputs are
* (a) the **section germ** `sheet i`: a local holomorphic biholomorphism `ℂ → ℂ` sending the base
  coordinate `b'` (the value-chart coordinate at `F (xs i) = coe b`) to the source coordinate `pre i`
  — supplied by the manifold inverse function theorem `Jacobians.exists_holo_localInverse` applied to
  `F = f.toRiemannSphere` at `xs i` (a regular point), read in charts;
* (b) the **trivialization↔chart compatibility** of `coeffAt` (already discharged: `coeffAt ω₀ (xs i)`
  is analytic on the chart target, `Jacobians.Dolbeault.coeffAt_analyticAt`, so each `coeff i` is
  meromorphic at `pre i`).

`FibreTrace.coeff_mero` then holds because `coeffAt ω₀ (xs i)` is analytic at `pre i` and `g`'s
chart-pullback is meromorphic there.

/-! ### Bridge (c) — the per-fibre residue bridge (definitional)

With `coeff i` chosen to be the chart integrand of `α = ω₀·g` at `xs i`, and `pre i` the chart image
of `xs i`, the residue `resAt (coeff i) (pre i)` is `formFnResidue ω₀ g (xs i)` by the very
definition of `formFnResidue`.  This is the bridge (c) that turns the abstract `FibreTrace` residue
sum into the geometric fibre residue sum of `α`. -/

/-! ### Bridge (a) — the planar section germ (local biholomorphism inverse)

The local section of the cover, read entirely in charts, is a *planar* local biholomorphism inverse:
given an analytic `φ : ℂ → ℂ` at `x₀` with `φ'(x₀) ≠ 0` and `φ x₀ = b`, the complex inverse function
theorem (`HasStrictDerivAt.localInverse` + `AnalyticAt.analyticAt_localInverse` +
`HasStrictDerivAt.to_localInverse`) produces a section `s` analytic at `b` with `s b = x₀`,
`deriv s b = (deriv φ x₀)⁻¹ ≠ 0`, and `φ (s w) = w` near `b`.  This is the analytic core of
`FibreTrace.sheet`, packaged with **all** the `FibreTrace` field hypotheses (`sheet_analytic`,
`sheet_deriv_ne`, `sheet_base`). -/

`deriv s b ≠ 0`, and `φ (s w) = w` on a neighbourhood of `b`.  (The complex inverse function

/-! ### The `FibreTrace` over an unramified fibre

Assembling (a)+(b)+(c): given a base value `b : ℂ` and a finite family of fibre points `xs : ι → X`,
each a **regular non-pole point** of `f` mapping to `b` (the chart pullback `g_{xs i} = f.holoRepr ∘
chart⁻¹` is analytic with nonzero derivative at `pre i = chart (xs i)`, and `f.holoRepr (xs i) = b`),
we build a `FibreTrace` over `b` whose per-sheet coefficient is the chart integrand of `α = ω₀·g` at
`xs i`.  Lemma 3.2 (`resAt_traceCoeff'`) then identifies its trace residue with the fibre residue sum
`∑ i, formFnResidue ω₀ g (xs i)`.

The per-sheet section `sheet i` is the planar inverse `s_i` of `g_{xs i}` (bridge (a)); `coeff_mero`
holds via bridge (b).  We bundle the *regularity inputs* (per-point analytic + deriv-nonzero) as
explicit hypotheses; they are exactly "`b` is a regular value off the pole/branch locus", to be
supplied by the global assembly from the finite critical-value set. -/

/-- **Per-fibre regularity data** for the cover `f` over the base value `b : ℂ`: a finite family of
fibre points `xs : ι → X`, each a non-pole regular point with `f.holoRepr (xs i) = b` and chart

input* the unramified-fibre `FibreTrace` is built from (supplied by the regular-value/IFT machinery
in the global assembly).  Parameterized by the form function `g` (its chart-pullback meromorphy
`hg_mero` is recorded so each per-sheet coefficient is meromorphic). -/
