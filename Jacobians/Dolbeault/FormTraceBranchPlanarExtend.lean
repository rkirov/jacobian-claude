# Planar removable extension of the geometric trace across a branch value (Gate A, §VIII.3)

The re-pointed Gate A path feeds the constructor `globalTrace_of_glue` an **arbitrary** value-chart
trace function `T : ℂ → ℂ` (it need not be `valueChartTrace`).  Its only genuinely-hard input is
`hT_off` — `T` is `AnalyticAt` at every value off the finite pole-values, *including across the
branch values* of the cover, where the per-sheet section derivatives of the regular fibre blow up.

This file supplies the **planar analytic engine** for that step: a function `T₀` that is

* complex-differentiable on a *punctured* neighbourhood of a branch value `b₀`
  (off the poles of `α = ω₀·g`, the trace is the analytic regular-fibre sum there), and
* satisfies the **boundedness crux** `(z − b₀)·T₀ z → 0` as `z → b₀`

has at worst a *removable* singularity at `b₀`: redefined to its punctured-limit value, it becomes
`AnalyticAt b₀`.  This is the planar shadow of the bundle-side `traceExtendsAt_branchPoint`
(`Jacobians/TraceForm.lean`) — but stated purely on `ℂ → ℂ`, so it applies directly to the
value-chart geometric trace.

The boundedness crux is the §VIII.3 analytic heart; for the planar trace it reduces *sheet by sheet*
to the proven one-variable atom `TraceForm.sub_div_deriv_tendsto_zero` (the ratio
`(F w − z₀)/F'(w) → 0` at a ramification point) — see `tendsto_zero_of_section_deriv` below, which
packages exactly that reduction for a single regular sheet's section derivative.

## What this file proves (axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`)

* `analyticAt_update_of_punctured_diff_of_tendsto_zero` — the planar removable-singularity extension:
  punctured-differentiable + `(z − b₀)·T₀ z → 0` ⟹ `Function.update T₀ b₀ (limUnder …)` is
  `AnalyticAt b₀`.
* `analyticAt_of_eventuallyEq_of_tendsto_zero` — the *germ* form: if `T` germ-equals such an extended
  function on a full neighbourhood of `b₀` (i.e. `T` already carries the correct limit value at `b₀`),
  then `T` is `AnalyticAt b₀`.  This is the exact shape `globalTrace_of_glue.hT_off` consumes at a
  branch value.
* `tendsto_zero_of_section_deriv` — the per-sheet boundedness reduction: for the planar section germ
  `s` of a regular sheet (a local biholomorphism inverse with `s b₀ = pre`, `deriv s b₀ ≠ 0`)… see
  its statement; this is the building block of the fibre-sum boundedness crux.

/-! ### The planar removable-singularity extension

Mathlib's little-o removable singularity theorem
(`Complex.differentiableOn_update_limUnder_insert_of_isLittleO`) takes a punctured-differentiable
function with `(f z − f c) =o[𝓝[≠] c] (· − c)⁻¹` and produces a differentiable (hence analytic)
extension.  We package the hypotheses in the form the geometric trace actually delivers: differentiable
on a punctured neighbourhood, plus the *little-o-of-`(·−c)⁻¹` shadow* `(z − c)·T z → 0`. -/

/-- **The boundedness crux is the little-o condition.**  If `(z − c)·T₀ z → 0` as `z → c` through
`z ≠ c`, then `(T₀ z − T₀ c) =o[𝓝[≠] c] (z − c)⁻¹` — exactly the little-o hypothesis of Mathlib's
removable-singularity theorem.  (`(T₀ z − T₀ c)/(z − c)⁻¹ = (z − c)·T₀ z − (z − c)·T₀ c`, and both
terms tend to `0`: the first by hypothesis, the second since `z − c → 0`.) -/

`b₀` — is `AnalyticAt ℂ` at `b₀`.

This is the planar shadow of the bundle-side `traceExtendsAt_branchPoint`: the geometric trace has at
worst a removable singularity at a branch value, so patching its value there makes it analytic. -/

/-- **Germ form of the planar removable extension (the `hT_off`-at-a-branch-value shape).**  Suppose
a function `T : ℂ → ℂ` germ-equals, on a *full* neighbourhood of `b₀`, the removable extension
`Function.update T₀ b₀ (limUnder (𝓝[≠] b₀) T₀)` of some `T₀` that is punctured-differentiable with the
boundedness crux.  Then `T` is `AnalyticAt b₀`.

In the application `T` is the genuine geometric trace (already carrying the correct extension value at
the branch value), `T₀` is its punctured (regular-fibre) form, and the germ-equality holds because the
two agree off `b₀` (regular fibre) and at `b₀` (`T` carries the limit).  This is the exact input
`globalTrace_of_glue.hT_off` needs at each branch value off the poles. -/

/-! ### Per-sheet boundedness reduction (the planar §VIII.3 atom for one regular sheet)

The fibre-sum boundedness crux `(z − b₀)·T₀ z → 0` reduces, term by term over the (finitely many)
sheets, to the boundedness of a single regular sheet's contribution
`(z − b₀)·coeff(s z)·deriv s z`.  Near a branch value the section `s` of a regular sheet (the planar
inverse of `f`'s chart-pullback `F` at a *ramification* point) has `deriv s` blowing up, but
`(z − b₀)·deriv s z → 0`: writing `S = s` as the inverse of `F` with `F(s b₀) = b₀`,
`deriv s z = 1/F'(s z)` and `z − b₀ = F(s z) − F(s b₀)`, so `(z − b₀)·deriv s z = (F w − b₀)/F'(w)`
with `w = s z → s b₀`, which `→ 0` by the proven one-variable atom (factor `F − b₀ = wᵉ·g`).

We isolate the clean consequence used by the assembly: if the section's contribution satisfies
`(z − b₀)·deriv s z → 0` and `coeff` is bounded near `s b₀` (it is analytic there, `α` holomorphic
off poles), then the per-sheet term `(z − b₀)·coeff(s z)·deriv s z → 0`. -/

/-- **Per-sheet term boundedness.**  If `(z − b₀)·deriv s z → 0` as `z → b₀` (the ramified-section
derivative blow-up is killed by the `z − b₀` factor — the planar §VIII.3 atom), `s` is continuous at
`b₀`, and `coeff` is continuous at `s b₀` (e.g. analytic there, `α = ω₀·g` holomorphic off poles),
then the per-sheet trace term `(z − b₀)·coeff(s z)·deriv s z → 0`.  Summed over the finite fibre this
gives the fibre-sum boundedness crux `(z − b₀)·T₀ z → 0`. -/

/-! ### The section-derivative atom (the planar §VIII.3 boundedness, from the proven ratio atom)

The per-sheet hypothesis `(z − b₀)·deriv s z → 0` of `tendsto_zero_perSheet` is the planar §VIII.3
boundedness for one sheet.  We discharge it from the proven one-variable ratio atom
`TraceForm.sub_div_deriv_tendsto_zero`.  The geometry: a regular-fibre section `s` near a *branch*
value `b₀` is the local inverse of `f`'s chart-pullback `F` at a *ramification* point `w₀ = lim s`,
so `F ∘ s = id` on the punctured neighbourhood and `F w₀ = b₀`.  Then `deriv s z = 1/F'(s z)` and
`z − b₀ = F(s z) − b₀`, so `(z − b₀)·deriv s z = (F w − b₀)/F'(w)` with `w = s z → w₀`, which `→ 0`
because `F − b₀ = (w − w₀)^e·g` with `g w₀ ≠ 0` (the ramification factorisation). -/

/-- **The section pushes the punctured neighbourhood forward.**  A section `s` continuous at `b₀`
with `s b₀ = w₀`, a left inverse `F` (`F ∘ s = id` near `b₀`), and `F w₀ = b₀`, maps `𝓝[≠] b₀` to
`𝓝[≠] w₀`: continuity gives `s z → w₀`, and `z ≠ b₀ ⟹ s z ≠ w₀` (else `z = F(s z) = F w₀ = b₀`). -/
