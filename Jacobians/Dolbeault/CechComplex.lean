  Dolbeault ladder — the concrete Čech complex and `H¹`, on a fixed finite cover.

  Design note (a module-instance diamond, found while
  building this): if the cochain spaces are `Π p, ↥(OmegaD D …)` (products of submodule-coes of
  function spaces), the quotient `↥(ker δ¹) ⧸ …` fails `HasQuotient` synthesis — two defeq-but-not-
  syntactic `Module ℂ (↥U → ℂ)` paths (`Pi.module` vs the algebra-induced one) clash through the
  `Submodule.module` layer (cf. `reference_module_real_diamond`). Fix (and the standard Čech setup):
  the cochains are *raw* functions `Π p, (↥… → ℂ)` (a clean, diamond-free `ℂ`-module), and the sheaf
  condition `𝒪_D` is carried as a `Submodule` *within* that ambient. `H¹` is then a quotient over a
  submodule-coe of the raw function-Pi, which is diamond-free.

  Light scaffolding: definitions + `δ² = 0` and the dimensions, with the analytic content isolated
  downstream. The only remaining gaps reachable from here are the two mechanical restriction leaves in
  `CechSection` plus `δ² = 0` (also mechanical).

/-- A **finite family** of opens of `X` (no covering condition). The Čech complex and `H¹` below are
defined at this level, so they apply both to a genuine `FiniteCover` (covering `X`) and to a family
covering only a chart-disk subregion — the latter is the honest, *inhabited* base for the disk-
acyclicity input (`H¹(disk, 𝒪) = 0`). (Previously the Čech complex lived on `FiniteCover`, whose
`covers = ⊤` made the single-chart `SharedChartCover` uninhabited and the disk-acyclicity vacuous.) -/

variable (𝔘 : FiniteFamily X) (D : Divisor X)

/-- A finite family is **Leray** (for `𝒪`): each set is simply connected — a simply-connected open
subset of a Riemann surface is biholomorphic to a disk or `ℂ`, hence `H¹(U_i, 𝒪) = 0` (the sets are
`𝒪`-acyclic).

This is *exactly* the hypothesis under which Čech `H¹` computes sheaf cohomology, and no more: every
node of the Riemann–Roch ladder is an `H¹` statement, and for `H¹` Cartan's comparison sequence
`0 → Ȟ¹(𝔘, 𝒪) → H¹(X, 𝒪) → Ȟ⁰(𝔘, ℋ¹(𝒪))` is an isomorphism as soon as the cover SETS are acyclic
(then the presheaf `ℋ¹(𝒪) : U ↦ H¹(U,𝒪)` vanishes on the cover, so `Ȟ⁰(𝔘, ℋ¹) = 0`). Acyclicity of
the *pairwise overlaps* is needed only for `H²` and higher, so it is NOT part of this predicate — it
was dead weight in the ladder (`GoodCover` proves the proven comparison never uses it), and dropping
it makes `LerayCoverExists.exists_lerayCover` UNCONDITIONAL (the chart-ball cover's simply-connected
sets are proven, `chartBallCover_simplyConnected`). The chart-disk cover satisfies this. -/
