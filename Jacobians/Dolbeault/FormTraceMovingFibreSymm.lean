# The symmetric-invariance lever for the moving-fibre coherence (Miranda §VIII.3)

`Jacobians.Dolbeault.FormTraceMovingFibreSheet` reduced the residue-theorem build's `∑Res = 0` to a
single `MovingSheetSelection`, whose per-value moving data is reduced (via
`MovingCoherenceDatum.ofSheetSections`) to the **§VIII.3 re-selection bijection** `hsel`: near each
base value `b₀`, an index bijection `e : (Φ b').ι ≃ D.ι` with `(Φ b').xs i' = sec (e i') b'`.

A prior round flagged a *false* obstruction here — "there is no global continuous sheet-labeling".
The key architectural unlock is that **the trace is monodromy-INVARIANT**:
`valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ b' = (fibreTrace ω₀ f (Φ b')).traceCoeff b'` is a *symmetric sum over the
sheets* of the fibre `Φ b'`, so it depends only on the fibre `Φ b'` **as a set**, not on any sheet
ordering/labeling. Consequently:

* The re-selection bijection `e` of `hsel` is quantified **pointwise per `b'`** (`∀ᶠ b', ∃ e, …`),
  *not* as a single continuous family. No global continuous labeling is ever required.
* A pointwise bijection `e : (Φ b').ι ≃ D.ι` with `(Φ b').xs i' = sec (e i') b'` **exists
  automatically** whenever the re-selected fibre points `(Φ b').xs` and the moving-section values
  `sec · b'` enumerate the **same finite set** (both injective with equal range) — by
  `Equiv.ofInjective` on each side and the range identification.

This file builds that lever: the value-matching index bijection from set-equality of two injective
enumerations (`equivOfInjective_image_eq`), and the **set-form** moving-coherence constructor
`MovingCoherenceDatum.ofSheetSectionsSet`, whose geometric input is the *labeling-independent* fact
that the moving fibre `Φ b'` and the sections enumerate the same fibre set — no bijection supplied
by the caller, no global continuity.

## What this file proves

* `equivOfInjective_image_eq` — from two injective `p q : · → X` with the same finite image, an
  index bijection `e : ι ≃ κ` with `p i = q (e i)` (the value-matching pointwise bijection; the
  symmetric lever's combinatorial core).
* `MovingCoherenceDatum.ofSheetSectionsSet` — `MovingCoherenceDatum.ofSheetSections` with the
  re-selection bijection `hsel` replaced by the **set-form** hypothesis `hset`: near `b₀`, the
  re-selected fibre `(Φ b').xs` is injective and its image equals the image of the section values
  `sec · b'`, with each section value in the matching chart source.  The bijection is reconstructed
  pointwise — *no labeling supplied by the caller*.

/-! ### The value-matching index bijection from set-equality (the symmetric lever's core)

The combinatorial heart of the symmetric-invariance lever: two injective enumerations `p : ι → Y`,
`q : κ → Y` of the **same set** (`Set.range p = Set.range q`) are matched by a bijection `e : ι ≃ κ`
with `p i = q (e i)`. The bijection is `(ofInjective p) ⬝ (range congr) ⬝ (ofInjective q)⁻¹`; the
value-matching is `Equiv.apply_ofInjective_symm`. This is exactly what produces the per-`b'`
re-selection bijection of `hsel` from the labeling-independent fact that the two fibre enumerations
have the same image — *no continuity, no global labeling*. -/

/-- **Value-matching bijection from equal ranges.**  For injective `p : ι → Y` and `q : κ → Y` with
`Set.range p = Set.range q`, there is a bijection `e : ι ≃ κ` with `p i = q (e i)` for all `i`. The
symmetric lever: two injective enumerations of the same fibre set are matched by *some* bijection,
with no continuity requirement. -/

/-! ### The set-form moving-coherence constructor (no labeling supplied)

`MovingCoherenceDatum.ofSheetSections` already quantifies its re-selection bijection `hsel`
**pointwise per `b'`** (`∀ᶠ b', ∃ e, …`) — there is *no* global-continuity requirement, contrary to
the prior round's flagged obstruction. The only residual is to *produce* that pointwise bijection.
By the symmetric lever, it exists automatically from set-equality: we supply the re-selection in
**set form** — near `b₀`, the re-selected fibre points `(Φ b').xs` are injective and enumerate the
*same set* as the section values `sec · b'` — and reconstruct `e` pointwise via
`equivOfInjective_image_eq`. This is the labeling-independent input: the caller asserts only that
the moving fibre *is* the sheet fibre as a set, never a sheet ordering. -/

/-- **A moving-fibre coherence datum from sheet sections, set form (no labeling).**  Identical to
`MovingCoherenceDatum.ofSheetSections` except the re-selection bijection `hsel` is replaced by the
**labeling-independent set form** `hset`: near `b₀`,

> the re-selected fibre points `(Φ b').xs` and the section values `fun i => sec i b'` are *both*
> injective and have the *same image*, and each `sec i b'` lies in `chart_{D.xs i}.source`.

The per-`b'` index bijection `e : (Φ b').ι ≃ D.ι` with `(Φ b').xs i' = sec (e i') b'` is
reconstructed *pointwise* by `equivOfInjective_image_eq` (the symmetric lever) — **no global
continuous labeling**, which the trace's monodromy-invariance (symmetric fibre sum) makes
unnecessary. All differentiability content is discharged by `MovingCoherenceDatum.ofSheetSections`.
