  Čech `H¹` finiteness on a CHART-DISK cover — the Forster GTM 81 Lemma 14.6 `leray` lift,
  analytic foundation.

  This file supplies the genuinely-new analytic content the `leray` field of
  `ChartDiskCover.holomorphicCoboundaries` (`ChartDiskFinitenessComplete.lean`) consumes: a
  **shrinking-level smooth partition of unity** on a `ChartDiskCover`, subordinate to the covering
  shrinking sets `shrinkSet a = V_a` (built in `ChartDiskFiniteness.lean` via the shrinking lemma),
  summing to `1` on ALL of `X`.

  ## Why a shrinking-level PoU (the fix over the cover-level PoU)

  Forster 14.6 lifts a SHRINKING cocycle `s` (holomorphic only on the relatively-compact overlaps
  `Wov (a,b) = φ_a '' (V_a ∩ V_b)`) to `s = δ⁰η + ρ x` with `x` a holomorphic COVER cocycle (on the
  full ball overlaps `Uov (a,b)`). The smooth split `g_a := ∑_c ρ_c · (chart-read of s_{ca})` must
  be smooth so its `∂̄` is a smooth datum. On the SHRINKING `V_a` this is automatic: the two opens
  `V_c ∩ V_a` (where `s_{ca}` lives) and `V_a \ tsupport ρ_c` (where `ρ_c = 0`) cover `V_a` — so
  each term `ρ_c · s_{ca}` is smooth on `V_a` (no boundary discontinuity). A COVER-level PoU
  (subordinate to `U_a`) would instead need `s_{ca}` on `V_c ∩ U_a`, which exceeds where the
  shrinking cocycle is defined. Hence the PoU must be subordinate to the SHRINKINGS, summing to `1`
  on `X` (the shrinkings cover `X`, `ChartDiskCover.iUnion_shrinkSet_eq_univ`).

  This mirrors `ChartCoverDbarGlue.exists_genuineCoverPoU` (the Montel-cover genuine PoU) but on the
  generic `ChartDiskCover` shrinking sets.

  See the (corrected) `leray` diagnosis in `ChartDiskFinitenessComplete.lean` for how this
  foundation fits the full lift: the `∂̄g_a` agree across charts as a global `(0,1)`-form (the
  cross-chart frame identity `∂̄g_a = conj(τ_{ab}′)·∂̄g_b∘τ` on `Wov`), so they GLUE to a global
  smooth form `ω̂` on `X` (the shrinkings cover `X`); its chart-`a` read on the FULL ball `U_a` is
  smooth and the frame identity then holds on the FULL `Uov (a,b)`. Solving `∂̄h_a = ω̂_a` on the
  ball (Forster 13.2, `DbarOpenDisk.dbar_solvable_open_disk`) yields `x_{ab} = h_b∘τ − h_a`
  holomorphic on the FULL `Uov` — the ball geometry's genuine unblock over the Montel cover.

The covering shrinking sets `shrinkSet a = V_a` (from `ChartDiskFiniteness`) genuinely cover `X`
(`iUnion_shrinkSet_eq_univ`), so a subordinate smooth PoU summing to `1` on all of `X` exists. -/
