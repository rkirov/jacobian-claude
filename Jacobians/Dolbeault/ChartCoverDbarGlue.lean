  Čech finiteness — the genuine-cover ∂̄-globalization FOUNDATION (Forster §13–§14, Dolbeault).

  This file banks the verified, axiom-clean foundation for discharging the (corrected) disk-acyclicity
  `leray` field of the chart-cover model — the cross-chart analogue of the single-chart prototype in
  `GluedDbarDatum.lean`.

  ## Why a fresh file (and why the SharedChartCover prototype does not directly apply)

  `GluedDbarDatum.lean` globalises a cocycle on a `SharedChartCover` — a finite family of opens living
  in ONE chart `φ = chartAt center`.  Its partition of unity sums to `1` only on a CLOSED CORE
  `C ⊊ ⋃ Uᵢ` (a subordinate PoU cannot sum to `1` on the open `⋃ Uᵢ` of a non-covering family on a
  connected `X`); that is precisely the obstruction `dbarDatum_agrees_on_interiorCore` documents — the
  glued datum agrees with `∂̄(chartPrim)` only on `interior C`, so it does NOT give a full
  `HasGluedDbarDatum`.  A single chart cannot cover a compact connected Riemann surface, so the
  `SharedChartCover` route is fundamentally partial.

  The GENUINE chart cover (`Montel`'s `chartCover`, the geometry of `CechModelGeometry.lean`) is a
  different beast: the OUTER opens `chartOpen a` (indexed by the cover charts `coverCenter a`) genuinely
  COVER `X` (`iUnion_chartOpen_eq`).  Therefore a smooth partition of unity subordinate to
  `(chartOpen a)` summing to `1` on ALL of `X` exists (`exists_genuineCoverPoU`, below) — exactly what
  `SharedChartCover` lacked.  This unblocks the PoU-globalization OVER THE COVERED REGION (here all of
  `X`), the right tool for the cross-chart Forster argument once the model's shrinking-side cochains are
  in the holomorphic (`BddHol`) representation (see the `⚠ SOUNDNESS NOTE` in `CechModelDifferential.lean`
  — the current continuous `Cshr` makes the literal `ChartCoverContinuousLeray` unprovable, so the telescoping is
  intentionally NOT plugged into that unsound field here).

  ## What is delivered (all sorry-free, axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`)

  * `exists_genuineCoverPoU` — a smooth PoU over `𝓘(ℝ,ℂ)`, subordinate to `(chartOpen (coverCenter a))`,
    summing to `1` on ALL of `X` (the genuine-cover globalization foundation).
  * `genuineCoverPoU` / `genuineCoverPoU_subordinate` / `sum_genuineCoverPoU_eq_one` — the chosen PoU and
    its sum-to-one-everywhere value form (no closed-core restriction needed — the cover covers).
  * `genuineCoverPoU_tsupport_subset` — the subordination `tsupport ρ_a ⊆ chartOpen (coverCenter a)`.

  ## What remains (the genuine analytic gap, documented — NOT a sorry here)

  The cross-chart telescoping of the Bott–Tu glued datum `ω̂ = ∑_{a,b}(ρ_b·h_{ab})·∂̄ρ_a` read across
  DIFFERENT charts (the `h_{ab}` live in chart-`a`, `chart-`b transitions enter), plus the holomorphic
  re-splitting `dbar_solvable_ball` per chart-disk, and the assembly into the holomorphic cover cocycle.
  This is Forster *Lectures on Riemann Surfaces* Thm 14.x / the Dolbeault lemma globalised by a PoU; it
  consumes `DbarDiskCohomology.dbar_solvable_ball` (proven) and the chart-transition Wirtinger chain rule
  (`dbarDisk_comp_holo`, proven in `CechDiskAcyclic`).  It is left for the corrected (holomorphic-`Cshr`)
  model; the single-chart telescoping in `GluedDbarDatum.dbarDatum_apply` is the prototype.

/-! ## The genuine-cover partition of unity (sum-to-one on ALL of `X`)

The outer opens `chartOpen (coverCenter a)` of `Montel`'s chart cover genuinely cover `X`, so — unlike a
`SharedChartCover` family — a subordinate smooth PoU summing to `1` on all of `X` exists.  We take the
closed sum-to-one locus `C := univ` (compact `X` is closed), so the closed-core PoU
`exists_smoothPartitionOfUnity_core` yields a genuine partition of unity over the whole surface. -/

shrinkings already cover (`iUnion_innerShrunkChart_coverCenter_eq`) and `innerShrunkChart ⊆ chartOpen`. -/

(the closed sum-to-one locus is `univ`).  This is the genuine-cover globalization foundation the
single-chart `SharedChartCover` could not supply: there the family does not cover `X`, so a subordinate
PoU can only sum to `1` on a closed core `C ⊊ ⋃ Uᵢ`; here the cover covers, so `C = univ`. -/
