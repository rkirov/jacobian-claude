  Dolbeault ladder — the ARTIFICIAL (single-point) chart-disk model of `exists_cechModel`.

  This file gives a fully sorry-free, axiom-clean witness for the *bundled* model existential
  `exists_cechModel_of_finiteDimensional`: assuming only that the genuine germ-class `H¹`,
  `𝔘.cechH1 D`, is finite-dimensional, it produces a `DiskOverlapData` + `Coboundaries` whose
  sup-norm `H¹` is `ℂ`-linearly isomorphic to `𝔘.cechH1 D`.

  THE TRICK (soundness). The honest `CechFinitenessWiring.exists_cechModel` builds a model whose
  `rhoRaw` is a COMPACT operator from the cover cochains to the shrinking cochains; the `leray`
  field of such a model would force a compact operator to surject the (possibly
  infinite-dimensional) cocycle space — impossible unless the cocycle space is finite-dimensional.
  Here we sidestep that by choosing each `Kov p` to be a SINGLE point `{0}`. Then `↥{0} →ᵇ ℂ ≅ ℂ`
  and the shrinking cochains `d.Cshr = ∀ p : Fin k, (↥{0} →ᵇ ℂ)` are FINITE-dimensional. A compact
  `rhoRaw` may freely surject a finite-dimensional target, so the `leray` field is genuinely
  provable (every shrinking cochain is the restriction of a CONSTANT bounded-holomorphic function).

  We then set `δ0 = δ1 = δ1cov = 0`. With `δ1 = 0` the cocycle space `Z¹(shrinking)` is all of
  `Cshr` (`ker 0 = ⊤`), and with `δ0 = 0` the coboundary `δ` is `0`, so `B¹ = range δ = ⊥`. Hence
  `c.supH1 = Cshr ⧸ ⊥ ≅ Cshr ≅ (Fin k → ℂ)`. Matching the dimension `k = finrank (𝔘.cechH1 D)`
  with `(Module.finBasis ℂ _).equivFun` closes the comparison.

  This is an ARTIFICIAL model: it does NOT compute `cechH1` from the actual cover geometry. It is a
  consistency witness — it shows the *shape* of the `exists_cechModel` conclusion is inhabitable for
  any finite-dimensional germ-class `H¹`, with the `leray`/compact-`rhoRaw` consistency respected
  (the one-point `Kov` keeps the shrinking side finite-dimensional). It is NOT a replacement for the
  honest manifold/Čech assembly.

/-! ### The bundled artificial model and the headline existential -/

/-- **The artificial (single-point) model witnesses the bundled `exists_cechModel` shape.** For any
finite-dimensional germ-class `H¹`, there is a `DiskOverlapData` + `Coboundaries` whose sup-norm
`H¹` is `ℂ`-linearly isomorphic to `𝔘.cechH1 D`.

Soundness: the model is artificial (it does NOT read the cover geometry); it uses a ONE-POINT
shrinking `Kov = {0}`, which keeps the shrinking cochains finite-dimensional, so the `leray` field
(forcing the compact `rhoRaw` to surject) is consistent and provable. The comparison composes
`𝔘.cechH1 D ≅ (Fin k → ℂ) ≅ Cshr ≅ supH1` with `k = finrank ℂ (𝔘.cechH1 D)`. -/
