  Dolbeault ladder — **STEP B of the Čech Leray cover-independence**: `refineH1` is a `ℂ`-linear
  isomorphism for two Leray covers (the crux of `CechFinitenessWiring.exists_cechModel`).

  Builds on STEP A (`CechRefinementHomotopy.refineH1_eq`, homotopy/index-independence of the
  refinement map) and the refinement chain-map machinery (`CechRefinement`).  See the `## PLAN` block
  of `CechRefinement.lean` for the full route.

  ## What is proven here (sorry-free, axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`)

    * **Round-trip / functoriality on `H¹`** (pure restriction algebra + STEP A):
        - `refineC1_id`  — the identity refinement is the identity on 1-cochains;
        - `refineH1_id`  — `(IsRefinement.id 𝔘).refineH1 D = LinearMap.id`;
        - `refineH1_comp` — `(hs.comp hr).refineH1 D = hs.refineH1 D ∘ₗ hr.refineH1 D` (functoriality,
          using `refineC1_comp` + descent through the quotient).
    * **Injectivity from a back-refinement** (STEP A + functoriality, sorry-free):
        - `refineH1_leftInverse` — a back-refinement `𝔘 ⪯ 𝔙` gives `refineH1 hs` as an explicit LEFT
          INVERSE of `refineH1 hr` (`(hs.comp hr).refineH1 = id` by STEP A, since `r∘s : 𝔘 → 𝔘` is a
          self-refinement, equal on `H¹` to the identity refinement);
        - `refineH1_injective` — hence `refineH1 hr` is injective.
    * **The mutual-refinement isomorphism** (sorry-free, NO analytic input):
        - `refineH1_equiv` — for covers `𝔙, 𝔘` with MUTUAL refinements `𝔙 ⪯ 𝔘` and `𝔘 ⪯ 𝔙`, both
          round-trips are self-refinements (= identity on `H¹` by STEP A), so `refineH1 hr` is a
          `ℂ`-linear bijection `cechH1 𝔘 D ≃ₗ[ℂ] cechH1 𝔙 D`.  This is the cover-independence
          isomorphism whenever the two covers mutually refine (in particular it does NOT need
          disk-acyclicity).

  ## What is the genuine analytic GAP (the surjectivity of a *strictly finer* Leray refinement)

  The `exists_cechModel` chaining goes through a COMMON refinement `𝔚 ⪯ 𝔘`, `𝔚 ⪯ 𝔙`, where `𝔚` is
  strictly finer and there is NO back-refinement `𝔘 ⪯ 𝔚`.  For such a strictly-finer Leray refinement
  the down-map `refineH1 (𝔚 ⪯ 𝔘)` being an iso needs the disk/overlap-acyclicity input
  `H¹(U_i ∩ U_j, 𝒪) = 0` (the proven `DbarDiskCohomology.dbar_solvable_ball` /
  `dbar_holo_splitting_ball`).  This file isolates that gap as the named predicate
  `RefinementSurjective` and proves the conditional upgrade `refineH1_equiv_of_surjective` (injectivity
  is unconditional via STEP A's `refineH1_leftInverse` only when a back-refinement exists — for the
  strictly-finer case injectivity ALSO needs the acyclicity, see the `## SURJECTIVITY` note).  The
  unconditional sorry-free deliverable is the mutual-refinement equiv `refineH1_equiv`.

  NO `sorry` in this file; everything not sorry-free is written prose, never a `sorry`.

The standard Leray injectivity, in the sorry-free *mutual-refinement* form: if `𝔙 ⪯ 𝔘` (via `r`) AND
`𝔘 ⪯ 𝔙` (via `s`), then the round-trip `r ∘ s : 𝔘.ι → 𝔘.ι` is a self-refinement of `𝔘`, so by STEP A
(homotopy/index-independence, `refineH1_eq`) it induces the SAME `H¹` map as the identity refinement,
namely `LinearMap.id`.  Functoriality (`refineH1_comp`) then exhibits `refineH1 hs` as an explicit
LEFT INVERSE of `refineH1 hr`, giving injectivity.  No analytic input. -/

/-- **A back-refinement gives a left inverse on `H¹`.**  If `𝔙 ⪯ 𝔘` (`hr`) and `𝔘 ⪯ 𝔙` (`hs`) then
`hs.refineH1 D ∘ₗ hr.refineH1 D = LinearMap.id`: the round-trip `r ∘ s` is a self-refinement of `𝔘`,
equal on `H¹` to the identity refinement by STEP A (`refineH1_eq`), and functorial by `refineH1_comp`.

`s∘r : 𝔙 → 𝔙` are self-refinements, hence equal on `H¹` to the identity by STEP A
(`refineH1_comp_eq_id`); so the two maps are mutually inverse.  Entirely sorry-free — it does NOT need

/-! ### The Leray analytic conditions for a STRICTLY-finer refinement (honest predicates)

The mutual-refinement equiv above covers the case where the two covers refine each other.  The
`exists_cechModel` chaining instead needs the case `𝔙 ⪯ 𝔘` with `𝔙` STRICTLY finer (a common
refinement), where there is NO back-refinement `𝔘 ⪯ 𝔙`.  For that case `refineH1 hr` being an iso is
the genuine Leray theorem, and the analytic content is isolated into the two cocycle-level predicates
below — both stated in the SAME "lift mod coboundary" shape as `CechFinitenessWiring.Coboundaries.leray`.
The conditional upgrades (`refineH1_surjective_of_lift`, `refineH1_injective_of_descend`,
`refineH1_equiv_of_leray`) are then sorry-free; the honest analytic obligation is to PRODUCE these
predicates from disk/overlap-acyclicity (the `## SURJECTIVITY` plan at the bottom). -/

/-! ## SURJECTIVITY — the precise plan and the exact remaining obstruction

This file reduces the STEP B Leray cover-independence iso to two cocycle-level analytic conditions:

  * `RefinementLift  hr D`  (surjectivity) — every `𝔙`-cocycle is `refineC1 g + δ⁰η` for a `𝔘`-cocycle
    `g`;  proven equivalent to `Function.Surjective (refineH1 hr)` (`refineH1_surjective_iff_lift`).
  * `RefinementDescend hr D` (injectivity) — a `𝔘`-cocycle whose refinement is a `𝔙`-coboundary is a
    `𝔘`-coboundary;  proven equivalent to `Function.Injective (refineH1 hr)`
    (`refineH1_injective_iff_descend`).

`refineH1_equiv_of_leray` then gives the iso from these two.  Everything above is SORRY-FREE.

For two covers that MUTUALLY refine, `refineH1_equiv` discharges BOTH conditions with NO analysis
(pure STEP A).  The genuinely-analytic gap is only for a STRICTLY-finer Leray refinement `𝔙 ⪯ 𝔘`
(the common-refinement case `exists_cechModel` needs), where there is no back-refinement.

### The standard construction of `RefinementLift` (Forster §12, Leray)

Let `t` be a `𝔙`-cocycle (`𝔙` strictly finer, refinement index `r : 𝔙.ι → 𝔘.ι`).  To build the
`𝔘`-cocycle `g` with `refineC1 g = t + δ⁰η`:

  STEP L1 (per coarse overlap).  Fix a coarse overlap `W = 𝔘.U i ⊓ 𝔘.U j`.  The fine sets
    `{𝔙.U a ⊓ W}_a` cover `W`, and `t` restricted to them is a 1-cocycle for that induced fine cover
    of `W`.  Because `W` is `H¹(𝒪)`-ACYCLIC (a connected/simply-connected overlap of a Leray cover,
    `IsLeray`), this restricted cocycle is a coboundary on `W`: there is a 0-cochain `ζ^{ij}_a` on
    `𝔙.U a ⊓ W` with `t_{ab}|_W = ζ^{ij}_b − ζ^{ij}_a`.
  STEP L2 (assemble the coarse cocycle).  Set `g_{ij} := ζ^{ij}_a − (refine of nothing)` glued across
    `a`; the differences `ζ^{ij}_b − ζ^{ij}_a = t_{ab}` patch to a single germ `g_{ij}` on `W` (the H⁰
    sheaf-gluing on the acyclic `W`).  One checks `δ¹_𝔘 g = 0` and `refineC1 g − t = δ⁰_𝔙 η` with
    `η_a := ζ^{r a, r a}_a` (the diagonal 0-cochain), all by `rawRestrictG`-bookkeeping.
  `RefinementDescend` is the SAME argument one degree down (Forster 12.8): given `refineC1 g = δ⁰_𝔙 η`,
    the per-coarse-overlap acyclicity glues `η` to a 0-cochain `ζ` on the coarse cover with
    `g = δ⁰_𝔘 ζ`.

### What is REACHABLE on top of the proven atoms, and the EXACT obstruction

The disk engine `DbarDiskCohomology.dbar_solvable_ball` / `dbar_holo_splitting_ball` proves
`H¹(𝒪) = 0` for a literal **Euclidean ball in `ℂ`**, at the level of *smooth/holomorphic FUNCTIONS*
(`ℂ → ℂ`).  STEP L1 needs `H¹(W, 𝒪_D) = 0` for an arbitrary coarse overlap `W ⊆ X` as a sheaf
statement at the *germ-class* (`MGerm`) level.  The exact missing pieces (all greenfield, confirmed
absent from Mathlib in the `CechRefinement.lean` PLAN recon):

  OBSTRUCTION 1 — *biholomorphic transport of disk-acyclicity to an abstract overlap.*  `IsLeray`
    gives `SimplyConnectedSpace ↥(𝔘.U i)` and connected overlaps, but NOT a biholomorphism
    `↥W ≃ ball` (that is the Riemann mapping / uniformization theorem, which Mathlib does not have for
    Riemann surfaces).  Without it one cannot pull `dbar_solvable_ball` back to `W`.  The honest fix in
    THIS repo's chart-disk model is to NOT use an abstract Leray `W` but to take `W` itself a chart
    disk — i.e. restate STEP L1 only for the chart-disk cover (the `ChartDiskCover` route already used
    by `CechModelGeometry`), where each cover set / overlap IS a disk in a single chart.  That is the
    "PARTIAL SIDESTEP" of the `CechRefinement.lean` PLAN.

  OBSTRUCTION 2 — *germ-class ↔ holomorphic-function bridge.*  `dbar_holo_splitting_ball` re-splits a
    smooth Čech splitting into a HOLOMORPHIC one as FUNCTIONS on the ball; STEP L1 needs the same at
    the `MGerm`/`OmegaDGerm` level (sections of `𝒪_D` are germ-classes modulo `codiscreteWithin`).
    Bridging is the `CechH0` codiscrete ↔ `𝓝[≠]` dictionary — the SAME bridge `exists_cechModel`'s
    comparison field requires.  This is in `CechH0`/`CechSection` territory (READ-ONLY here) and is not
    re-derivable in this file without duplicating it.

  OBSTRUCTION 3 — *the nested Čech "acyclic ⟹ cocycle is a coboundary" step itself.*  Even granting
    `H¹(disk, 𝒪) = 0` as a clean germ-level atom, STEP L1 turns a fine cocycle ON an overlap into a
    coboundary by a one-dimension-down Leray/Čech computation (a mini cover-independence).  This is
    genuinely a second instance of the same theorem and is the bulk of the "~several hundred LoC on
    top of the disk atom" estimate; it is NOT a quick reduction.

CONCLUSION.  The reduction to `RefinementLift` / `RefinementDescend` is complete and sorry-free; the
remaining work is to PRODUCE those two predicates for a chart-disk Leray refinement.  The single most
load-bearing missing lemma is a germ-level *disk-acyclicity atom*

    `H¹(𝔙|_W, 𝒪_D) = 0`  for `W` a chart disk,  i.e.  every `MGerm`-cocycle on a finite fine cover
    of a chart disk `W` is an `MGerm`-coboundary,

obtained by transporting `dbar_holo_splitting_ball` through the `CechH0` germ↔function bridge
(OBSTRUCTION 2) on a literal chart disk (sidestepping OBSTRUCTION 1), then run once per coarse overlap
(OBSTRUCTION 3).  Building that atom requires editing `CechSection`/`CechH0` (out of scope for this
file) or importing a new bridge; hence it is left as written prose, NOT a `sorry`.  The mutual-
refinement iso `refineH1_equiv` is the unconditional sorry-free fallback already delivered.
