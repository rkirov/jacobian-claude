# The branch-value-patched global trace `Tᵉˣᵗ` and the residue theorem `∑Res = 0` (Miranda
§VIII.3 — the close)

This file is the **unification step** for the residue-theorem assembly (`∑ₐ Resₐ(α) = 0`, `α = ω₀·g`).
All conceptual walls are down; the proven engines are wired into one instantiation of
`globalTrace_of_glue` (`FormTraceGlobalTAssemble`), using the **value-correct branch-patched trace**
— *not* the false `hbranch`/`BranchAwareTraceSelection` continuity route (the raw `valueChartTrace`
value at a branch value is a *partial* sheet sum, not the analytic-continuation limit, so it is
discontinuous there).

The fix — exactly Miranda's "the trace is a single (mero)morphic function on `ℂℙ¹`, extending across
branch points" — is to **patch** the geometric trace to its removable limit at each branch value, so
that the patched trace `Tᵉˣᵗ` is genuinely `AnalyticAt` everywhere off the pole-values, via the
proven planar removable engine `FormTraceBranchPlanarExtend`/`FormTraceBranchValueOff`.

## The patched trace

For a finite branch-value set `br : Finset ℂ`,

> `valueChartTracePatched ω₀ f Φ br z := if z ∈ br then limUnder (𝓝[≠] z) (valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ)
>                                       else valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ z`,

i.e. `valueChartTrace` everywhere except at the (finitely many) branch values, where it is replaced
by its punctured-limit value (the multi-point `Function.update` form of
`valueChartTrace_branchExtension`). The patch only changes the value at the finitely-many branch
values, so it shares **all** the finite/`∞` glue with `valueChartTrace`, while being analytic *at*
each branch value (the partial-sum junk is repaired to the limit).

## What this file proves

* `valueChartTracePatched` — the multi-point branch-patched trace, with `…_eventuallyEq` (germ-equal
  to `valueChartTrace` off `br`) and `…_of_not_mem` (equal off `br`).
* `analyticAt_valueChartTracePatched_off_centres` — the full `hT_off` for `Tᵉˣᵗ`: at every value off
  the pole-centres, `Tᵉˣᵗ` is analytic — regular values via the moving-sheet coherence
  (germ-transport), branch values via the **patched** removable engine
  (`analyticAt_branchExtension_valueChartTrace`, needing punctured analyticity + the boundedness
  crux — *no* false continuity demand).
* `PatchedTraceSelection` — the assembled residue-theorem input using `Tᵉˣᵗ`: the per-value moving-sheet
  coherence (no labeling, via the symmetric lever), the **branch-value boundedness condition** (the
  genuine §VIII.3 analytic content, reduced sheet-by-sheet to the proven ratio atom), the `∞`-glue,
  junk-freeness, and the genus-`0` `∞`-vanishing.
* `residueSum_eq_zero_of_patchedTraceSelection` — **the residue theorem `∑Res = 0`** from it,
  via the proven `residueSum_eq_zero_of_glue`.
* `patchedTraceSelection_empty` / `…_holomorphic` — end-to-end non-vacuity (empty-pole case).

## The genuine remaining obligation

After this unification the *only* non-bookkeeping content carried by `PatchedTraceSelection` is
exactly Miranda's §VIII.3 geometry:

1. the **branch-value boundedness condition** `(z − b₀)·valueChartTrace z → 0` (the §VIII.3 analytic
heart; reduced sheet-by-sheet to the proven
`FormTraceBranchPlanarExtend.tendsto_zero_section_deriv`); 2. the **germ-coherence** (the per-value
moving-sheet data + the `∞`-glue) — the branched-cover monodromy, handled labeling-free by the
symmetric lever; and 3. the genus-`0` `∞`-vanishing + junk-freeness.

The false `hbranch` continuity route is *not* revived: branch values are handled by the
value-correct patch, whose analyticity rests on the boundedness condition (genuine, partially proven) —
never on continuity of the raw partial-sum trace.

/-! ### The branch-value boundedness condition from sheet sections (the §VIII.3 analytic port)

This is **the one genuinely-new analytic step** of the close: discharge the boundedness condition `hbnd`
`(z − b₀)·valueChartTrace z → 0` at a branch value `b₀` from the proven planar per-sheet ratio atom
`FormTraceBranchPlanarExtend.tendsto_zero_section_deriv`.

Near a branch value `b₀`, the geometric trace is, on a punctured neighbourhood, the **moving fibre
sum** `∑ j, chartIntegrand ω₀ g x_j (rinv_j z)·deriv (rinv_j) z` read along the chart pullbacks
`rinv_j = chart_{x_j} ∘ sec_j` of the cover sheets `sec_j : ℂ → X` through *all* the preimages `x_j`
of `b₀` (ramified **and** unramified — `sec_j` is a continuous section of `f.holoRepr`, its chart
pullback a right-inverse of `φ_j := f.holoRepr ∘ chart_{x_j}.symm`). Each per-sheet term satisfies
the bound:

* `(z − b₀)·deriv (rinv_j) z → 0` — the proven ratio atom `tendsto_zero_section_deriv`, with the
  section `s := rinv_j` and its analytic left-inverse `F := φ_j` (`φ_j (rinv_j z) = z` near `b₀`,
  `φ_j w₀ = b₀`, `φ_j` not eventually constant since `f` is nonconstant; the ramified-sheet
  derivative blow-up is killed by the `z − b₀` factor — *no* Puiseux/symmetric-function machinery,
  just `φ_j − b₀ = (w − w₀)^e·g`);
* `chartIntegrand ω₀ g x_j` is continuous at `rinv_j b₀ = w₀` (`α = ω₀·g` holomorphic at the
  non-pole `x_j` — the adapted cover separates poles from the branch locus).

Summed over the finite fibre (`tendsto_zero_fibreSum`/`tendsto_zero_perSheet`) and transported along
the moving-sum germ-equality, this gives `hbnd`. This is the planar shadow of the proven bundle-side
`TraceForm.traceLocalCoeff_mul_sub_tendsto_zero_Y` — but the uniform-cardinality/finite-subcover
machinery is *replaced* by the explicit sheet enumeration `sec_j` supplied per branch value (the
moving selection's fibre data), and the per-sheet content is the same proven ratio atom. -/

/-- **The branch-value boundedness condition from sheet sections.**  Let `b₀ : ℂ` and `ι : Type*` finite.
Suppose the geometric trace germ-equals, on the *punctured* neighbourhood of `b₀`, the moving fibre
sum along chart pullbacks `rinv : ι → ℂ → ℂ` of sheet sections through preimages `x : ι → X` of
`b₀`:

* `hgerm` —
  `valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ =ᶠ[𝓝[≠] b₀]
  fun z => ∑ j, chartIntegrand ω₀ g (x j) (rinv j z)·deriv (rinv j) z`;
* per sheet `j`: `rinv j b₀ = w₀ j := (chartAt ℂ (x j)) (x j)` (`hbase`); `rinv j` continuous at
  `b₀` (`hcont`); `φ_j := f.holoRepr ∘ chart_{x j}.symm` analytic at `w₀ j` (`hF_an`), with
  `φ_j (w₀ j) = b₀` (`hFw₀`) and `φ_j` not eventually constant near `w₀ j` (`hFnc`);
  `φ_j (rinv j z) = z` near `b₀` (`hsec`); the chain-rule identity
  `deriv (rinv j) z · deriv φ_j (rinv j z) = 1` near `b₀` (`hchain`); and
  `chartIntegrand ω₀ g (x j)` continuous at `w₀ j` (`hcoeff` — `α` holomorphic at the non-pole
  `x j`).

Then the boundedness condition `(z − b₀)·valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ z → 0` holds. *Proof.* Each per-sheet
term `→ 0` by `tendsto_zero_perSheet` (the coeff continuous × the ratio atom
`tendsto_zero_section_deriv`); sum over the finite fibre (`tendsto_zero_fibreSum`); transport along
`hgerm`. -/

/-- **The branch-value boundedness condition from smooth sheet sections.**  The reduced interface for
`tendsto_zero_valueChartTrace_of_sections`: the per-sheet differentiability/right-inverse data is
*derived* from a family of smooth cover sheets `sec : ι → ℂ → X` through the preimages
`x j := sec j b₀` of `b₀`. The caller supplies only the genuine geometric content:

* `hsmooth` — each `sec j` is `C^ω` at `b₀`;
* `hsec_sec` — each `sec j` is a section of `f.holoRepr` near `b₀` (`f.holoRepr (sec j b') = b'`);
* `hnp` — each `x j = sec j b₀` is a **non-pole** of `f` (`0 ≤ orderAtPoint`), so
  `φ_j := f.holoRepr ∘ chart_{x j}.symm` is analytic at `chart_{x j}(x j)`;
* `hFnc` — `φ_j` is not eventually constant `≡ b₀` near `chart_{x j}(x j)` (the cover is
  nonconstant);
* `hcoeff` — `chartIntegrand ω₀ g (x j)` is continuous at `chart_{x j}(x j)` (`α` holomorphic at the
  non-pole `x j`);
* `hgerm` — the moving-sum germ-equality of `valueChartTrace` with the fibre sum along the chart
  pullbacks `chart_{x j} ∘ sec j` (the per-value monodromy content).

The right-inverse identity `hsec`, the base/continuity, the analytic left-inverse `hF_an`/`hFw₀`,
and the chain-rule identity `hchain` are all discharged from the section smoothness + non-poleness
via `chartPullback_section_rinv`, `analyticAt_holoRepr_chartPullback_of_orderNonneg`, and
`differentiableAt_chart_pullback_section`. -/

/-! ### Off-centre analyticity of the patched trace (`hT_off`)

`hT_off` for the patched trace dispatches each value off the pole-centres to either:
* a **regular value** (off `centres ∪ br`): there the patch is inert on a *full* neighbourhood
  (branch values isolated), so analyticity transfers from `valueChartTrace` (the moving-sheet
  coherence); or
* a **branch value** `b₀ ∈ br`: there `Tᵉˣᵗ` germ-equals the single-point removable extension
  `valueChartTrace_branchExtension ω₀ f Φ b₀`, which is `AnalyticAt b₀` by the proven planar engine
  `analyticAt_branchExtension_valueChartTrace` (needing punctured analyticity + the boundedness
  crux). -/

/-- **Analyticity of the patched trace at a regular value** (off `br`): the patch is inert on a full
neighbourhood of `z` (a small ball avoids the finite `br`), so analyticity transfers from

/-! ### Punctured analyticity at a branch value from the regular-value coherence

The branch-value removable engine needs `valueChartTrace` analytic on a *punctured* neighbourhood of
each branch value `b₀`. Branch (and pole) values are isolated, so a small punctured ball around `b₀`
avoids the finite set `(centres ∪ br) \ {b₀}` and lands in the regular-value regime, where `hreg`
gives analyticity. This is the same isolation argument as `analyticAt_valueChartTrace_off_centres`,
extracted so the patched assembly can feed `hbranch`'s punctured-analyticity input from `hreg`. -/

/-- **Punctured analyticity at a branch value from the regular-value coherence.**  If
`valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ` is analytic at every value off `centres ∪ br` (`hreg`), then at any
`b₀` it is analytic on the punctured neighbourhood `𝓝[≠] b₀` (a small punctured ball avoids the
finite `(centres ∪ br) \ {b₀}`).  Supplies the punctured-analyticity input of the branch-value
removable engine from the regular-value coherence — no branch-specific data. -/

/-! ### The patched trace selection — the assembled residue-theorem input

We bundle the genuine §VIII.3 geometry into one structure, feeding the value-correct **patched**
trace `Tᵉˣᵗ = valueChartTracePatched ω₀ f Φ br` to `residueSum_eq_zero_of_glue`. Mirrors
`BranchAwareTraceSelection` for the finite/`∞` bookkeeping and the pole-value coherence, but:

* the off-exceptional content is split into a per-regular-value moving-sheet coherence datum `Creg`
  (no labeling, via the symmetric lever) **and**, at the finitely-many branch values, the genuine
  §VIII.3 **boundedness condition** `hbnd` (replacing the *false* `BranchAwareTraceSelection.hbranch`
  continuity — the raw trace value at a branch value is a partial sum, hence discontinuous);
* `hT_off` for `Tᵉˣᵗ` is then `analyticAt_valueChartTracePatched_off_centres`: regular values via
  the coherence (patch inert), branch values via the value-correct removable extension (whose
  analyticity rests on `hbnd`, never on continuity).

The finite glue / `∞`-glue / junk-freeness / genus-`0` for `Tᵉˣᵗ` are transported from
`valueChartTrace` along the germ-equalities (`valueChartTracePatched_eventuallyEq`,
`recipCoeff_valueChartTracePatched_eventuallyEq`) — `Tᵉˣᵗ` differs only at the finitely-many branch
values, so it shares every germ at the centres and at `∞`. -/

/-- **A patched-trace selection** for `α = ω₀·g` over `poles`, relative to an adapted cover `hac`.
The honest §VIII.3 residue-theorem input feeding the value-correct **patched** trace to
`residueSum_eq_zero_of_glue`:

* `Φ`, `cs`/`ρ`/`hcenters_cs`, `Dinf`/`hxs_*` — the global selection + finite/`∞` enumeration;
* `Cfin i` (with `hCfin_D`) — the per-pole-value moving-sheet coherence datum (fixed fibre = the
  pole sub-fibre; *no labeling*);
* `br : Finset ℂ` — the finite branch values;
* `Creg z` (for `z ∉ cs ∪ br`) + `hCreg_g` — the per-regular-value moving-sheet coherence datum with
  `g`'s chart-pullback analytic at its fibre points (regular-value analyticity);
* `hbnd` — at each branch value off the centres, the §VIII.3 **boundedness condition**
  `(z − b₀)·valueChartTrace z → 0` (the genuine analytic content; reduced sheet-by-sheet to the
  proven ratio atom);
* `hglue_inf` / `hcont_int` / `R₀`+`hR₀_*` — the `∞`-glue, junk-freeness, genus-`0` `∞`-vanishing,
  all phrased for the **patched** trace `Tᵉˣᵗ` (= `valueChartTracePatched ω₀ f Φ br`).

`br = ∅` (no branch values, so `hbnd` is vacuous and the patch is inert:
`valueChartTracePatched … ∅ = valueChartTrace … ≡ 0`), the per-regular-value empty moving datum, the
