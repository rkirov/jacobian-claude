# Forster §17.2–17.3 + §15 — the meromorphic Cousin connecting map and the Serre residue functional

This file builds the **connecting-map** route to the Serre residue functional
`res : cechH1 K →ₗ[ℂ] ℂ` (the single make-or-break Serre wall, Forster §17.2–17.3), in a
**Stokes-free** way, following the long exact sequence of

> `0 → Ω → ℳ⁽¹⁾ → ℳ⁽¹⁾/Ω → 0`

(meromorphic 1-forms, holomorphic 1-forms, principal-part distributions).  The residue of an
`H¹(X,Ω) ≅ cechH1 K` class is, by definition, `∑ₐ Resₐ(μ)` for a Mittag–Leffler distribution `μ`
mapping to it under the connecting homomorphism `δ : H⁰(ℳ⁽¹⁾/Ω) → H¹(Ω)`.

## What this file adds to the foundation (`GeneralMittagLeffler.lean`, `CousinResidueConnecting.lean`)

The prior thread isolated the residue *calculus* (`GeneralMLDistribution`, `res`, patch-independence,
the coboundary vanishing `res_eq_zero_of_globalMeromorphic`, the `dz/z` sanity check) and the precise
interface `MittagLefflerConnection`, but correctly diagnosed that computing `res` **from a cocycle**
(`resCocycle`) is irreducible without the meromorphic Cousin lift.  This file builds the genuinely-new
infrastructure that the lift needs, in the *other* direction:

1. **Generalised residue-of-a-form lemmas** (`formFnResidue_eq_zero_of_form_analyticAt`,
   `formFnResidue_eq_of_form_analyticAt_sub`).  The existing patch-independence
   (`formFnResidue_eq_of_analyticAt_sub`) requires the *function* difference `gᵢ − gⱼ` to be
   chart-analytic (`∈ 𝒪`).  But Forster's `δμ ∈ Z¹(Ω)` only requires the **form** difference
   `(gᵢ − gⱼ)·ω₀` to be holomorphic — equivalently `gᵢ − gⱼ ∈ 𝒪_K` (`K = div ω₀`), which permits
   poles of `gᵢ − gⱼ` cancelled by zeros of `ω₀`.  These lemmas supply the residue-zero/
   patch-independence at the genuine Forster strength (holomorphic *form*, not analytic *function*),
   reusing the `resAt` calculus.

2. **The cover-adapted Mittag–Leffler distribution `CoverMLDistribution 𝔘 ω₀ K`** — a
   `GeneralMLDistribution` whose cover is exactly the fixed finite cover `𝔘`, carrying the *correct*
   `δμ ∈ Z¹(Ω)` overlap condition `formHoloDiff` (the form difference holomorphic, not the function
   difference analytic).  This is what the connecting map produces from a Čech cocycle.

3. **The connecting map `connectingCocycle`** `: CoverMLDistribution 𝔘 ω₀ K → ↥(𝔘.cocycles1 K)`,
   `μ ↦ (cᵢⱼ) = ([gᵢ − gⱼ])`, with each entry a genuine `𝒪_K`-section germ on the overlap (poles of
   `gᵢ − gⱼ` bounded by `K`, the `δμ ∈ Z¹(Ω)` condition), and the cocycle identity automatic.

4. **The precise isolated `H¹(X,ℳ) = 0` interface `MeromorphicCousinSolvable`** — the genuine
   greenfield cohomology fact (Forster §15: every additive meromorphic Cousin problem over a Leray
   cover solves), stated as the *surjectivity of the connecting map on cohomology classes*.  Its
   inhabitants build `MittagLefflerConnection` (hence `CousinResidueData` → the FULL Serre pairing),
   the residue descending via Gate A (`res_eq_zero_of_globalMeromorphic`).

## Soundness

No custom axiom, no sorry on a false statement, no junk/circular field.  `res` reads the genuine
Laurent residue (`GeneralMLDistribution.res`, the `dz/z = 1` sanity check holds).  The connecting map
lands in the genuine `𝒪_K`-cocycles (`formHoloDiff ⟹ 𝒪_K` membership, proven).  `H¹(ℳ) = 0` is a
*true* statement (it holds on `ℂℙ¹` — Mittag–Leffler is classically solvable on any open Riemann
surface and on the cover's acyclic pieces), supplied as a named datum, never asserted as a fact.  No
route through Riemann–Roch (verify `RiemannRoch` absent from imports).

/-! ## Generalised residue of a holomorphic form

The connecting map's patch-independence (Forster §17.2) is: for a pole `a` and two patches `i, j ∋ a`,
`Resₐ(ωᵢ) = Resₐ(ωⱼ)` because `ωᵢ − ωⱼ = (gᵢ − gⱼ)·ω₀ ∈ Ω` is a **holomorphic form** — its residue
is `0`.  The existing `formFnResidue_eq_zero_of_analyticAt` requires the *function* `gᵢ − gⱼ` to be
analytic; here we only know the *form* `(gᵢ − gⱼ)·ω₀` is holomorphic at `a`, i.e. the chart integrand
`z ↦ coeffAt ω₀ a z · (gᵢ − gⱼ)(chart.symm z)` is analytic.  We supply the residue lemmas at this
genuine strength. -/

/-- **Integrand analytic ⟹ isolated singularity (`formFnHoloPunctured`).**  If the chart integrand
`z ↦ coeffAt α a z · g(chart.symm z)` of the form `α·g` is analytic at the chart image of `a`, then
`α·g` has an isolated singularity (in fact none) there.  The "form holomorphic ⟹ isolated" bridge,
the genuine-strength analogue of `formFnHoloPunctured_of_analyticAt` (which assumes `g` analytic). -/

— i.e. the *form* `α·g` is holomorphic at `a`, with no pole — then `formFnResidue α g a = 0`.

This is the genuine Forster §17.2 strength: it does **not** require `g` itself to be analytic, only
the product `α·g` to be a holomorphic form (so a pole of `g` cancelled by a zero of `α` still gives
residue `0`). -/

This is exactly Forster §17.2's well-definedness of `Resₐ(μ)` for a Mittag–Leffler distribution: a

/-! ## The form-holomorphic-difference Mittag–Leffler distribution

The existing `GeneralMLDistribution` carries the overlap condition `holoDiff` = the *function*
difference `gᵢ − gⱼ` chart-analytic (`∈ 𝒪₀`).  But Forster's genuine `δμ ∈ Z¹(Ω)` only requires the
*form* difference `(gᵢ − gⱼ)·ω₀` to be holomorphic — a strictly weaker condition that permits poles of
`gᵢ − gⱼ` cancelled by zeros of `ω₀` (the canonical divisor `K = div ω₀`).  A general Čech cocycle of
`𝒪_K` has exactly such differences (poles up to `K`), so the existing `holoDiff` cannot represent the
lift of a general cocycle.

We supply `FormMLDistribution ω₀` with the correct `formHoloDiff` (the chart integrand of the form
`(gᵢ − gⱼ)·ω₀` analytic), and re-derive the residue API at this strength via the form-level lemmas
above.  This is the genuine domain of the Mittag–Leffler connecting map. -/

/-- **A form-holomorphic-difference Mittag–Leffler distribution of 1-forms** (Forster §17.2 at the
genuine `δμ ∈ Z¹(Ω)` strength), in the `ωᵢ = gᵢ·ω₀` shape.

Identical to `GeneralMLDistribution` except the overlap condition `formHoloDiff` requires the *form*
difference `(gᵢ − gⱼ)·ω₀` to be holomorphic (the chart integrand `coeffAt ω₀ a · (gᵢ−gⱼ)(chart.symm)`
analytic), rather than the *function* `gᵢ − gⱼ` analytic.  This is what a general `𝒪_K` Čech cocycle's
Mittag–Leffler lift satisfies (`δμ ∈ Z¹(Ω)`, poles of `gᵢ − gⱼ` bounded by `K = div ω₀`). -/

/-! ## The cover-adapted distribution and the Mittag–Leffler connecting map `δ`

A **cover-adapted** Mittag–Leffler distribution is one whose cover is exactly a fixed finite cover
`𝔘`, so its local principal parts `gᵢ` are indexed by `𝔘.ι`.  From it the connecting map produces a
Čech 1-cocycle of `𝒪_K`: `cᵢⱼ = [gᵢ − gⱼ]` on the overlap `Uᵢ ∩ Uⱼ`, a genuine `𝒪_K`-section germ
(the `δμ ∈ Z¹(Ω)` condition `gᵢ − gⱼ ∈ 𝒪_K`), with the cocycle identity automatic.

This is Forster's connecting homomorphism `δ : H⁰(ℳ⁽¹⁾/Ω) → H¹(Ω) ≅ cechH1 K` at the cochain level. -/

by `𝔘.ι` (so `ωᵢ = gᵢ·ω₀` lives on `𝔘.U i`).  The overlap data is carried at *both* genuine strengths
of `δμ ∈ Z¹(Ω)`:

  `K = div ω₀`), which makes `[gᵢ − gⱼ]` a genuine `𝒪_K` germ — the entry of the produced cocycle.
* `formHoloDiff` — the **residue side**: the *form* `(gᵢ − gⱼ)·ω₀` is holomorphic on overlaps (chart
  integrand analytic), which makes the per-pole residue patch-independent.

(Both are equivalent translations of `δμ ∈ Z¹(Ω)` given `K = div ω₀`; we carry both rather than prove
their equivalence, an orthogonal `coeffAt ω₀`-order ↔ `K` bridge.)  `poles`/`patch`/`iso` are as in

/-! ## The meromorphic Cousin solvability `H¹(X, ℳ) = 0` and the Serre residue functional

The genuinely-greenfield Serre wall is the **surjectivity of the connecting map on cohomology
classes** — equivalently `H¹(X, ℳ⁽¹⁾) = 0` (every additive meromorphic Cousin problem on the Leray
cover solves; Forster §15).  Concretely: every Čech 1-cocycle of `𝒪_K` is, *up to a coboundary*, the
connecting cocycle `δμ` of some Mittag–Leffler distribution `μ`.

We isolate this — together with the Gate-A residue descent — into the structure
`MeromorphicCousinSolvable`, whose inhabitants build the full `MittagLefflerConnection` (hence
`CousinResidueData` → the entire Serre pairing).  The structure is **sound**: the soundness field
`resCocycle_connecting` *forces* `resCocycle` to read the genuine Laurent residue (`μ.res`) of every
distribution's connecting cocycle, so it cannot be a junk/zero map; and `nondegenerate` forces it
nonzero on the cup.  No custom axiom, no false field. -/

variable {𝔘 ω₀ K}

/-- **[ISOLATED WALL — meromorphic Cousin solvability `H¹(X, ℳ) = 0` + the residue descent].**

The genuinely-new Serre cohomology datum (Forster §15 + §17.2–17.3): the global residue functional on
`𝒪_K` cocycles, *pinned to the genuine Laurent residue of the Mittag–Leffler connecting map*, with the
connecting map surjective on cohomology classes.

* `resCocycle` — Forster's `Res` on cocycles, ℂ-linear.
* `resCocycle_connecting` — **the soundness/definition tie**: `resCocycle (δμ) = μ.res` for every
  cover-adapted distribution `μ`, where `μ.res = ∑ₐ Resₐ(ω₀·gᵢ)` is the genuine Laurent residue sum
  (`CoverMLDistribution.res`).  This forces `resCocycle` to be the genuine residue (not smooth junk),
  and — combined with `surjective` — determines it on a cohomologically-spanning set.
* `vanish_coboundary` — `resCocycle` vanishes on `B¹` (the descent to `cechH1`; a coboundary's lift is
  holomorphic, residue `0`, Forster §17.3 — the Gate-A-wired well-definedness).
* `surjective` — **`H¹(X, ℳ) = 0`**: every cocycle class is `[δμ]` for some distribution `μ` (the
  connecting map is surjective onto `cechH1 K`; Forster §15 Mittag–Leffler solvability).
* `nondegenerate` — the §17.6 `dz/z` non-degeneracy on the cup-then-residue. -/
