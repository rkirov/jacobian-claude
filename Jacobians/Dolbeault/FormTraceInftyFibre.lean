# The `∞`-fibre reciprocal-chart trace (Miranda §VIII.3 step 5 — `infty_eq` reduced to agreement)

This file builds the **`∞`-fibre** analogue of `Jacobians.Dolbeault.FormTraceFibre`: Miranda's Lemma
3.2 read at the pole fibre `F⁻¹(∞)` in the reciprocal chart `ζ = 1/w` of `ℂℙ¹` (base coordinate
`0`). It reduces the `infty_eq` field of `TraceRationalityWitness` — in its reciprocal-chart form
`resAt (recipCoeff L.R) 0 = ∑_{a : F a = ∞} Res_a α` (the proved bridge
`FormTraceInftyRecip.resAtInfty_eq_resAt_recipCoeff`) — to a single honest geometric input,
*structurally identical to the finite case*: **`recipCoeff L.R` agrees with the reciprocal-chart
trace coefficient off `0`**.

## The reciprocal-chart `∞`-fibre, via the generic `FibreTrace`

The finite-centre engine `FormTraceFibre.fibreReg`/`fibreTrace` is hard-wired to the value chart
`w = f.holoRepr` (its `FibreRegularData` carries the chart-pullback of `f.holoRepr`).  Near `∞` the
relevant value coordinate is the **reciprocal** `ζ = 1/f.holoRepr`, so we cannot reuse
`FibreRegularData` directly.  Instead we build the trace over the `∞` fibre using the *generic*
`Jacobians.MeromorphicTrace.FibreTrace` (sheets + coefficients), with

* `b := 0` — the reciprocal coordinate of `∞`;
* `pre i := chart_{xs i} (xs i)` and `coeff i := chartIntegrand ω₀ g (xs i)` — **the same
  source-chart data as the finite case** (the `1`-form `α = ω₀·g`'s chart integrand at the fibre
  point `xs i`), so bridge (c) `resAt (coeff i) (pre i) = formFnResidue ω₀ g (xs i)`
  (`resAt_chartIntegrand_eq_formFnResidue`) is *unchanged* — the residue of `α` at a point is read
  in the source chart, independent of the value chart;
* `sheet i` — the planar inverse of the **reciprocal-chart cover map** `z ↦ 1/f.holoRepr(chart⁻¹ z)`
  (a local biholomorphism at `pre i` sending `pre i ↦ 0`, when the pole `xs i` is *unramified for
  `f` over `∞`* — `f` simple there), supplied by `exists_planar_section`.

With this, Lemma 3.2 (`FibreTrace.resAt_traceCoeff'`, unconditional) gives
`resAt (∞-trace coeff) 0 = ∑ i, formFnResidue ω₀ g (xs i)` — the `∞`-fibre residue sum.  Then if
`recipCoeff L.R` agrees with the `∞`-trace coefficient off `0`, `resAt_congr` turns the LHS of the
reciprocal `infty_eq` into the `∞`-fibre residue sum.

## The `∞`-regularity input

A pole `a` of `α` mapping to `∞` is *unramified for `f` over `∞`* iff the reciprocal `1/f.holoRepr`
read in charts is a local biholomorphism at `chart a` (analytic, nonzero derivative, value `0`). We
carry this as the structure `InftyFibreData` (the honest geometric input — `f` unramified over `∞`
at the pole fibre, e.g. the generic-cover choice), mirroring `FibreRegularData` field-for-field.

## Main results

* `inftyFibreTrace` — the generic `FibreTrace` over the `∞` fibre (base `0`), from `InftyFibreData`;
* `resAt_traceCoeff_inftyFibreTrace` — the `∞`-fibre Lemma 3.2:
  `resAt (∞-trace coeff) 0 = ∑ i, formFnResidue ω₀ g (xs i)`;
* `inftyResidueSum_eq_filter` — the `∞`-fibre residue sum equals the fibre-restricted pole-set sum
  `∑_{a : F a = ∞} Res_a α` (when `xs` enumerates exactly the `∞` fibre);
* `resAt_recipCoeff_eq_inftyResidueSum_of_agree` — the reciprocal `infty_eq`, from the agreement
  `recipCoeff L.R =ᶠ[𝓝[≠] 0] (∞-trace coeff)`.

This is the honest reduction of `infty_eq` to the same "`L` represents `Tr_F α`" agreement the
finite case rests on — the residual content is now uniformly *agreement of `L` with the trace germ*
(finite charts + reciprocal chart), i.e. the trace's global rationality.

/-- **Per-`∞`-fibre regularity data** for the cover `f` over `∞`: a finite family of fibre points
`xs : ι → X` (the poles of `α` mapping to `∞`), each *unramified for `f` over `∞`* — the
**reciprocal-chart cover map** `z ↦ (f.holoRepr (chart⁻¹ z))⁻¹` is a local biholomorphism at
`pre i = chart (xs i)`, sending it to the reciprocal coordinate `0` of `∞`. This is the honest
geometric input the `∞`-fibre `FibreTrace` is built from (the generic-cover choice makes `f`
unramified over `∞`). Mirrors `FibreRegularData`, with `1/f.holoRepr` (the reciprocal value) in
place of `f.holoRepr`. -/

Pure `Finset` combinatorics, mirroring `FormTraceFibre.fibreResidueSum_eq_filter` for the `∞`
fibre: when `xs` injectively enumerates exactly the poles `a ∈ poles` with `F a = ∞`, the per-fibre
residue sum is the fibre-restricted residue sum that appears in `infty_eq`. -/

`hxs_surj`), then the per-fibre residue sum over `D` equals the `∞`-fibre-restricted residue sum:

/-! ### `infty_eq` reduced to the reciprocal-chart agreement

The honest analogue of `FormTraceRationalReduce.resAt_eq_fibreResidueSum_of_agree` at `∞`: if the
reciprocal coefficient `recipCoeff L.R` agrees with the `∞`-fibre trace coefficient off `0`, then
the reciprocal `infty_eq` holds. -/

/-- **The reciprocal `infty_eq`, from the reciprocal-chart agreement.**  If `recipCoeff L.R` agrees
with the `∞`-fibre trace coefficient `(inftyFibreTrace ω₀ f D).traceCoeff` on a punctured
neighbourhood of `0`, and `D`'s `xs` enumerates exactly the `∞` fibre, then

> `resAt (recipCoeff L.R) 0 = ∑_{a ∈ poles, F a = ∞} formFnResidue ω₀ g a`,

i.e. the reciprocal-chart form `hinftyRecip` of the `infty_eq` field
(`traceRationalityWitness_of_agree_recip`).

*Proof.* `resAt (recipCoeff L.R) 0 = resAt (∞-trace coeff) 0` (agreement, `resAt_congr`), which is
the `∞`-fibre residue sum (`resAt_traceCoeff_inftyFibreTrace`), which is the `∞`-fibre-restricted
pole-set sum (`inftyResidueSum_eq_filter`). -/
