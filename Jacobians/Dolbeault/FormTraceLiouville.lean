# Liouville vanishing for `dz`-coefficients on `ℂℙ¹` (Miranda §VIII.3 step 3)

The §VIII.3 trace-rationality argument closes with the **vanishing of the holomorphic remainder**:
after subtracting the finite principal parts of the meromorphic trace `Tr_F α` (a `LaurentForm L`)
one obtains a global *holomorphic* `1`-form on the compact `ℂℙ¹`, which must be **zero** (the
sphere has genus `0`, `H⁰(ℂℙ¹, Ω) = 0`).  This file proves that vanishing at the level of
`dz`-coefficient functions `ℂ → ℂ`, the representation the trace machinery (`FormTraceFibre`,
`FormTraceInftyFibre`,
`recipCoeff`) actually uses.

A global holomorphic `1`-form on `ℂℙ¹`, read in the affine chart, is an **entire** coefficient
`h : ℂ → ℂ` of `dz`; read in the reciprocal chart `ζ = 1/z` it is the coefficient `recipCoeff h`
(`recipCoeff h ζ = −h(ζ⁻¹)·ζ⁻²`, the `dz = −ζ⁻² dζ` Jacobian).  Holomorphy at `∞` means
`recipCoeff h` extends **analytically across `0`**.  The transition forces `h(z) = O(z⁻²) → 0`
at `∞`, so the entire `h` is bounded with limit `0`, hence (complex Liouville,
`Differentiable.eq_const_of_tendsto_cocompact`) `h ≡ 0`.

This is the *coefficient-level* form of `Jacobians.holomorphicOneForm_eq_zero`
(`Jacobians/ProjectiveLine.lean`, the genus-`0` vanishing proven for honest cotangent-bundle
sections); the analytic core is re-proved directly for raw coefficient functions, so the trace
remainder (a `ℂ → ℂ` coefficient, *not* packaged as a `HolomorphicOneForms RiemannSphere` section)
can be concluded zero without first building a bundle section.

## Main results

* `coeff_tendsto_cobounded_of_recipCoeff_continuousAt` — `O(z⁻²)` decay at `∞`: an `h : ℂ → ℂ`
  whose reciprocal coefficient `recipCoeff h` is continuous at `0` tends to `0` along
  `cobounded ℂ`.
* `coeff_eq_zero_of_entire_of_recipCoeff_continuousAt` — **the Liouville vanishing**: an *entire*
  `h` with `recipCoeff h` continuous at `0` is identically `0`.
* `coeff_eqOn_of_entire_diff_of_recipCoeff_continuousAt` — the **two-coefficient** corollary used
  by the trace assembly: if `h₁ − h₂` is entire and `recipCoeff (h₁ − h₂)` is continuous at `0`,
  then `h₁ = h₂` on all of `ℂ` (hence germ-agree at every finite point), and
  `recipCoeff h₁ = recipCoeff h₂` off `0` (germ-agree at `0` in the reciprocal chart) — exactly
  the `hagree_fin` / `hagree_inf` shape of `TraceAgreementData` once the holomorphic-remainder
  hypotheses are supplied.

/-! ### `O(z⁻²)` decay at `∞` from analyticity of the reciprocal coefficient

For `z ≠ 0`, `recipCoeff h (z⁻¹) = −h(z)·z²`, so `h(z) = −z⁻²·recipCoeff h (z⁻¹)`.  As
`|z| → ∞`, `z⁻¹ → 0` and (continuity of `recipCoeff h` at `0`) `recipCoeff h (z⁻¹) →
recipCoeff h 0` is bounded, while `z⁻² → 0`; hence `h(z) → 0`.  This is the `O(z⁻²)` decay
underlying the Liouville step. -/

/-- **`recipCoeff h` at `z⁻¹` is `−h(z)·z²`** (for `z ≠ 0`).  The transition law `dz = −ζ⁻² dζ` read
the other way: substituting `ζ = z⁻¹` into `recipCoeff h ζ = −h(ζ⁻¹)·ζ⁻²` gives `−h(z)·z²`. -/

/-! ### The Liouville vanishing for coefficients

An entire `h` that tends to `0` at `∞` is constant (`Differentiable.eq_const_of_tendsto_cocompact`),
and the limit `0` forces the constant to be `0`. -/

/-- **Liouville vanishing for `dz`-coefficients.**  An **entire** coefficient `h : ℂ → ℂ`
(`AnalyticOnNhd ℂ h univ`) whose reciprocal coefficient `recipCoeff h` is **continuous at `0`** (the
form extends holomorphically across `∞`) is identically `0`:

> a global holomorphic `1`-form on `ℂℙ¹` is zero.

*Proof.*  `h` is entire hence differentiable; it tends to `0` at `∞`
(`coeff_tendsto_cobounded_of_recipCoeff_continuousAt`, via `cobounded = cocompact` on `ℂ`); by
complex Liouville (`Differentiable.eq_const_of_tendsto_cocompact`) it is the constant `0`.  This
is the coefficient-level form of `Jacobians.holomorphicOneForm_eq_zero`. -/

/-! ### The two-coefficient corollary (the `TraceAgreementData` shape)

For the trace assembly we have two coefficients `h₁ = Tr_F α` and `h₂ = L.R`; their difference is
the *holomorphic remainder* (entire, holomorphic across `∞`).  The Liouville vanishing gives
`h₁ = h₂` everywhere — both as functions on `ℂ` (finite-chart germ-agreement) and, taking
`recipCoeff`, off `0` in the reciprocal chart (`∞`-germ-agreement). -/

/-- **Two-coefficient Liouville agreement.**  If the difference `h₁ − h₂` is entire and its
reciprocal coefficient is continuous at `0` (the remainder is a global holomorphic form), then
`h₁ = h₂` on **all of `ℂ`**.  *Proof.*  `h₁ − h₂ = 0` by
`coeff_eq_zero_of_entire_of_recipCoeff_continuousAt`. -/

  have := congrFun h0 z
  simpa [sub_eq_zero] using this

/-- **Finite-chart germ-agreement** from the Liouville agreement: at every finite point `p`, the two
coefficients germ-agree on the punctured neighbourhood `𝓝[≠] p` (in fact they are equal everywhere).
This is the `hagree_fin`-shaped output. -/

/-- **Reciprocal-chart germ-agreement** from the Liouville agreement: `recipCoeff h₁` and
`recipCoeff h₂` germ-agree on `𝓝[≠] 0` (the reciprocal chart matches off the centre).  Since
`h₁ = h₂` everywhere, `recipCoeff h₁ = recipCoeff h₂` everywhere, in particular near `0`.  This
is the `hagree_inf`-shaped output. -/
