# The fibre-sum bridge: bundle trace ↔ planar fibre trace (Gate A step 2/3)

Building on the per-sheet covector linchpin (`FormTraceSheetCovector`) and the `localRep`
frame-transition law, this file proves the **single-sheet bridge**: the bundle pushforward summand
`sheetPullback ω₀ s y (1)` (read in the value chart) equals the *planar* `FormTraceFibre.fibreTrace`
summand `coeffAt ω₀ (xs) (sh w)·deriv(sh) w` for the `g ≡ 1` frame, where `sh` is the section read in
the **fixed** source chart at a base fibre point `xs`.

The reconciliation is the `dz`-Jacobian cancellation: the bundle summand is read in the *moving*
fibre point's own chart, the planar summand in the *fixed* `xs`-chart; the `localRep` frame-transition
law (`localRep_eq_transition_mul_self`) supplies the ratio, which the chain rule for `deriv` cancels
against the section-derivative ratio.  This is the source-chart-independence of the value-chart
`dz`-coefficient — the heart of Miranda §VIII.3's "the trace is a well-defined form".

/-- **Single-sheet bridge (source-chart independence of the `dz`-coefficient).**  For a bundle
section `s : Y → X` `MDifferentiable` at `y`, with the fibre point `s y` lying in the chart source of
a *fixed* base point `xs`, the bundle per-sheet covector (value chart, affine unit tangent) equals the
planar `coeffAt·deriv` summand read in the fixed `xs`-chart:

> `sheetPullback ω₀ s y 1 = coeffAt ω₀ xs (sh (chart_y y)) · deriv sh (chart_y y)`,

where `sh := chart_xs ∘ s ∘ chart_y.symm` is the section in the fixed source chart.  The proof reads
the LHS via the linchpin (`sheetPullback_one_eq_coeffAt_mul_deriv`, in the *moving* `s y`-chart), then
applies the `localRep` frame-transition law + the chain rule for `deriv` to convert to the fixed
`xs`-chart. -/

/-! ### The `g`-weighted single-sheet bridge (the `fibreTrace` summand)

`α = ω₀·g` is meromorphic, so the `g`-weight rides per-sheet inside the coefficient
`coeff i = chartIntegrand ω₀ g (xs i)`.  The `g`-weighted bundle summand is the holomorphic
per-sheet covector times the per-sheet scalar `g (s y)` (the value of `g` at the fibre point); it
equals the planar `FormTraceFibre.chartIntegrand·deriv` summand. -/

/-- **`g`-weighted single-sheet bridge.**  The holomorphic per-sheet bundle covector
`sheetPullback ω₀ s y 1` weighted by `g (s y)` (the value of `g` at the fibre point) equals the
planar `FormTraceFibre.fibreTrace` summand `chartIntegrand ω₀ g xs (sh w)·deriv(sh) w` for the section
`sh := chart_xs ∘ s ∘ chart_y.symm` read in the fixed `xs`-chart.  This is
`sheetPullback_one_eq_fixedChart_coeffAt_mul_deriv` multiplied by the per-sheet `g`-scalar, with
`chartIntegrand ω₀ g xs (sh b') = coeffAt ω₀ xs (sh b')·g (s y)` (the `g`-pullback at `chart_xs.symm
(sh b') = s y`). -/

/-! ### Uniqueness of the holomorphic local inverse (section identification core, step 2 (A))

The planar section `exists_planar_section` (the `fibreTrace` sheet) and the chart-representation of a
bundle sheet are *both* right-inverses of the same chart map `φ` (analytic, `deriv ≠ 0`) through the
same point.  By uniqueness of the holomorphic local inverse they germ-agree — the section
identification half of step 2.  We prove the clean planar uniqueness here. -/

/-- **Uniqueness of the holomorphic local inverse (germ form).**  If `φ` is analytic at `x₀` with
`deriv φ x₀ ≠ 0` and `φ x₀ = b`, then any two continuous right-inverses `s₁`, `s₂` of `φ` through `x₀`
(`sₖ b = x₀`, `φ (sₖ w) = w` near `b`, `sₖ` continuous at `b`) germ-agree near `b`:
`s₁ =ᶠ[𝓝 b] s₂`.  Both equal the canonical `localInverse` near `b` (via
`HasStrictDerivAt.eventually_left_inverse` composed with the right-inverse property). -/
