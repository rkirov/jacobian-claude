# Holomorphic extension of the trace across branch values (Miranda §VIII.3 — removable singularity)

The off-exceptional analyticity `hT_off : ∀ z ∉ centres, AnalyticAt ℂ (valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ) z` of
the geometric trace (consumed by `residueSum_eq_zero_of_glue`) must hold at **every** value off the
finite pole-values — *including the branch (critical) values* of the cover `F = f.toRiemannSphere`.
At a branch value there is **no local sheet system**, so the moving-sheet route (`hreg`/`hsetReg`
via `exists_sphereSheetSystem`) does *not* apply there.

This is Miranda's §VIII.3 point that the trace `Tr_F α` is a *single (mero)morphic function on
`ℂℙ¹`* — the symmetric functions of the sheet values are single-valued and bounded across branch
points, so the trace **extends holomorphically across them** (Riemann's removable-singularity
theorem). In Lean this is exactly
`Complex.analyticAt_of_differentiable_on_punctured_nhds_of_continuousAt`: a function analytic on a
*punctured* neighbourhood of `z` and *continuous at* `z` is analytic at `z`.

This file packages that extension, reducing the branch-value analyticity to its two honest inputs:
* **punctured analyticity** — `valueChartTrace` is analytic at every value in a punctured
  neighbourhood of the branch value (supplied by the regular-value coherence at the nearby
  *non-branch* values, since branch values are isolated); and
* **continuity at the branch value** — the genuine §VIII.3 boundedness/single-valuedness content
  (the symmetric trace extends continuously across the branch point).

It then gives a clean `hT_off` constructor that handles **all** values off the centres: regular
values via the moving-sheet coherence, branch values via the removable-singularity extension — so
the only branch-specific input is the continuity (Riemann extension), never a sheet system.

## What this file proves

* `analyticAt_valueChartTrace_of_punctured_continuous` — branch-value analyticity from punctured
  analyticity + continuity (Riemann's removable singularity, specialised to `valueChartTrace`).
* `analyticAt_valueChartTrace_off_centres` — the full off-centre analyticity `hT_off`, dispatching
  each value to either the regular-value coherence (`hreg`) or the removable-singularity extension
  at the finitely-many branch values (`hbranch`).

/-! ### Branch-value analyticity via removable singularity

At a branch value `z` of the cover, the geometric trace is analytic on a *punctured* neighbourhood
of `z` (the nearby values are regular, by isolation of branch points) and, by the §VIII.3
single-valuedness/boundedness, *continuous at* `z`. Riemann's removable-singularity theorem
(`Complex.analyticAt_of_differentiable_on_punctured_nhds_of_continuousAt`) then gives analyticity at
`z`. This is the holomorphic extension of `Tr_F α` across the branch point — no sheet system
required at `z` itself. -/

/-- **Branch-value analyticity of the geometric trace (Riemann's removable singularity).**  If
`valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ` is analytic at every value in a *punctured* neighbourhood of `z` (`hpunct`)
and is *continuous at* `z` (`hcont` — the §VIII.3 single-valuedness/boundedness across the branch
point), then it is **analytic at `z`**. This is Miranda's holomorphic extension of the trace across
a branch value, via `Complex.analyticAt_of_differentiable_on_punctured_nhds_of_continuousAt`; the
only branch-specific input is the continuity (the trace extends), never a sheet system. -/

/-! ### The full off-centre analyticity (regular ⊕ branch)

We assemble `hT_off : ∀ z ∉ centres, AnalyticAt ℂ (valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ) z`.  The finitely-many
**branch values** off the centres are collected in a `Finset br`; at every value off `centres ∪ br`
(a *regular non-pole* value), analyticity comes from the moving-sheet coherence `hreg`.  At a branch
value `z ∈ br` (off the centres), analyticity comes from the removable-singularity extension
(`analyticAt_valueChartTrace_of_punctured_continuous`): a punctured neighbourhood of `z` avoids the
finitely-many points `centres ∪ br` (they are isolated), so `valueChartTrace` is analytic there by
`hreg`, and the continuity at `z` is supplied by `hbranch`. -/

/-- **Off-centre analyticity of the geometric trace, dispatching regular vs branch values.**  Let
`centres br : Finset ℂ` (the finite pole-values and the finite branch values, respectively).
Suppose:

* `hreg` — at every value `w` off `centres ∪ br` (a regular non-pole value),
  `valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ` is analytic at `w` (the moving-sheet coherence, dischargeable via the
  sphere sheet system there); and
* `hbranch` — at every branch value `z ∈ br` off the centres, `valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ` is
  *continuous at* `z` (the §VIII.3 single-valuedness across the branch point — the Riemann-extension
  input).

Then `valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ` is analytic at **every** value off the centres `z ∉ centres`. Regular
values use `hreg`; branch values `z ∈ br` use the removable-singularity extension, whose punctured
analyticity holds because a small punctured ball around `z` avoids the finite set `centres ∪ br`.
This is the honest `hT_off`: the *only* branch-specific input is the continuity (Riemann extension),
never a sheet system at the branch point. -/
