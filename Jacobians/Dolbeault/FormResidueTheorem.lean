# The general 1-form residue theorem `∑ₐ Resₐ(α) = 0`

For a compact connected Riemann surface `X`, a holomorphic 1-form `ω₀ : HolomorphicOneForms X`, and
a function `g : X → ℂ`, the **meromorphic 1-form** `α = ω₀·g` satisfies the residue theorem

> `∑_{a ∈ X} Res_a(α) = 0`,   i.e.   `residueSum ω₀ g (poles) = 0`,

where `Res_a(α) = formFnResidue ω₀ g a` is the local Laurent residue read in the canonical chart at
`a` (`Jacobians.Dolbeault.formFnResidue`) and `residueSum` (`Jacobians.Dolbeault.MittagLeffler`) is
the finite sum over the (finitely many) poles.

The well-definedness of the residue functional `Res : H¹(X, Ω) → ℂ` on cohomology classes (Forster
17.3) rests on exactly this — a globally-defined (coboundary) meromorphic 1-form has total residue
`0`. It is the **general higher-order-pole** statement, strictly more than `deg_div` (which is the
simple-pole `α = df/f` special case, `Jacobians.ResidueTheoremX`).

## The route (Miranda §VIII.3, the trace to ℙ¹)

The proof is the algebraic residue theorem via the **trace to `ℂℙ¹`**: pick a nonconstant
meromorphic `f : X → ℂℙ¹` (a branched cover `F = f.toRiemannSphere`, supplied by Riemann–Roch), form
the trace `Tr_F α` (a rational 1-form on `ℂℙ¹`), and compute

```
∑_{x∈X} Res_x(α)  =  ∑_{y∈ℂℙ¹} ∑_{x∈F⁻¹y} Res_x(α)        (regroup by fibre)
                  =  ∑_{y∈ℂℙ¹} Res_y(Tr_F α)              (Miranda Lemma 3.2)
                  =  0                                     (ℂℙ¹ residue theorem).
```

The two one-variable engines are unconditional, in `Jacobians.ResidueChangeOfVariables`:

* the fibre Lemma 3.2 `FibreTrace.resAt_traceCoeff'` — `Res_b(Tr_F α) = ∑_{sheets i} Res_{pre i}` —
  and
* the trace combine `finiteResidueSum_trace_eq_zero_of_fibres'` —
  `(∑_{centers p} Res_b(Tr_F α over fibre p)) + Res_∞(Tr_F α) = 0` —

both in `Jacobians.ResidueChangeOfVariables` (the `'`-forms, no `ResidueChangeOfVariables`
hypothesis), built on the `ℂℙ¹` residue theorem
`LaurentForm.finiteResidueSum_add_resAtInfty_eq_zero` (`Jacobians.TraceResidue`).

## What this file builds

This file is the **manifold trace assembly** — the generalization of `Jacobians.ResidueTheoremX`
(the `df/f`/`deg_div` simple-pole assembly) to a general meromorphic 1-form, reusing the now-general
feeders. It mirrors that file field-for-field:

* the **fibrewise regrouping** (`residueSum_eq_fiberwise`, `residueSum_eq_infty_add_finite`): the
  finite residue-sum `∑_{a ∈ poles} formFnResidue ω₀ g a` partitions along the fibres of
  `F = f.toRiemannSphere` into the `∞`-fibre (the poles of `α` mapping to `∞`) and the finite-value
  fibres — pure `Finset` combinatorics (`Finset.sum_fiberwise_of_maps_to`), in `formFnResidue` in
  place of `orderAtPoint`;
* the **trace-representation structure** `FormResidueTrace ω₀ g` (the §VIII.3 assembly output — the
  rational trace `LaurentForm L = Tr_F α`, the per-fibre `FibreTrace` data, Lemma 3.2's manifold
  bookkeeping `hL32`, and the two aggregate fibre-residue ↔ `formFnResidue` identifications
  `infty_eq` / `finite_eq`);
* **the residue theorem** (`residueSum_eq_zero_of_formResidueTrace`,
  `formFnResidue_total_eq_zero_of_formResidueTrace`): given a `FormResidueTrace ω₀ g`, the total
  residue vanishes — *completely* from the general trace combine + the regrouping;
* **non-vacuity** (`formResidueTrace_of_holomorphic`): a `FormResidueTrace ω₀ g` exists when
  `α = ω₀·g` is globally holomorphic (the empty `LaurentForm`, no poles), confirming the structure's
  obligations are *true and satisfiable*, not a disguised `False`.

## The trace data (constructed downstream)

What is *not* built here is the construction of a `FormResidueTrace ω₀ g` for a general
nonconstant `f`: the rational `LaurentForm L` representing `Tr_F α` (the cover's local holomorphic
sections, the trace's finiteness/rationality, partial fractions on `ℂℙ¹`), Lemma 3.2's manifold
bookkeeping `hL32`, and the two aggregate fibre-residue ↔ residue identifications
`infty_eq` / `finite_eq`.  That §VIII.3 trace assembly is isolated into the `FormResidueTrace`
structure (each field a *true, non-vacuous* statement) and carried out in the `FormTrace*` and
`SerreResidue*` modules, with everything downstream of the structure proved here.

/-! ### The fibrewise regrouping `∑_{a ∈ poles} = ∑_y ∑_{F⁻¹y}`

The finite residue-sum `∑_{a ∈ poles} formFnResidue ω₀ g a` of `α = ω₀·g` over its (finite) pole set
partitions, fibrewise, along the cover `F = f.toRiemannSphere`: grouping the poles by their image
under `F` and summing the residue within each fibre recovers the total.  Pure `Finset` combinatorics
(`Finset.sum_fiberwise_of_maps_to`), independent of the analytic fibre packaging — the bridge that
turns `∑_{a ∈ X} Res_a(α)` into a sum over `ℂℙ¹` of fibre sums.  (Identical to
`Jacobians.ResidueTheoremX.orderSum_eq_fiberwise`, with `formFnResidue ω₀ g` for `orderAtPoint`.) -/

/-- **The fibrewise regrouping of the residue-sum.**  Partition a pole set `poles : Finset X` by the
fibres of `F = f.toRiemannSphere`: the total residue is the sum, over the image points `y` of
`poles`, of the per-fibre residue sums.

/-! ### The trace representation `FormResidueTrace ω₀ g`

The remaining content is the **global manifold assembly** of the meromorphic trace `Tr_F α`
(`α = ω₀·g`) through the cover `F = f.toRiemannSphere`: packaging the (finite, off-branch) fibres as
`FibreTrace`s, exhibiting the rational trace as a `LaurentForm L` on `ℂℙ¹`, and identifying — via
the **general** Lemma 3.2 (`FibreTrace.resAt_traceCoeff'`, now unconditional) and the local-residue
bridge — each fibre's residue with the fibre's residue sum `∑_{a ∈ F⁻¹y} Res_a(α)`.

We package this output as the structure `FormResidueTrace ω₀ g` below; each field is a *true*
statement (it is exactly what the §VIII.3 trace assembly produces) and **not** vacuous.  Given a
`FormResidueTrace ω₀ g`, the residue theorem `∑_{a ∈ poles} Res_a(α) = 0` follows *completely* from
the general trace combine (`finiteResidueSum_trace_eq_zero_of_fibres'`) and the fibrewise regrouping
(`residueSum_eq_infty_add_finite`), as proved in `residueSum_eq_zero_of_formResidueTrace`.

This isolates the geometric content (the trace's finiteness/rationality + Lemma 3.2's manifold
bookkeeping `hL32` + the per-fibre residue ↔ `formFnResidue` identifications) into the two
aggregate identifications `infty_eq` and `finite_eq`, with everything downstream proved.

The crucial difference from `Jacobians.ResidueTheoremX.LogDerivTrace`: there are no simple-pole
fields (`cs`/`hsp`) and no `ResidueChangeOfVariables` hypothesis — `α = ω₀·g` has *higher-order*
poles, so we use the **general** unconditional combine `finiteResidueSum_trace_eq_zero_of_fibres'`.

/-- **The 1-form trace representation** of `α = ω₀·g` through `F = f.toRiemannSphere`.

This bundles the output of the global manifold assembly of the meromorphic trace `Tr_F α` on `ℂℙ¹`
for the general 1-form residue theorem:

* `f` — a (nonconstant) meromorphic function giving the branched cover `F = f.toRiemannSphere`;
* `poles` — the finite set of poles of `α = ω₀·g` (off it, `α` is holomorphic);
* a `LaurentForm L` (partial-fraction `1`-form on `ℂℙ¹`) representing `Tr_F α`;
* a fibre datum `fibre p : FibreTrace` for each finite center `p`;
* `hL32`: each finite center's fibre-residue sum equals `L`'s residue there (the manifold
  bookkeeping that `L` *is* the trace — Lemma 3.2 at the finite centers,
  `FibreTrace.resAt_traceCoeff'`);
* `infty_eq`: the residue at infinity of the trace equals the **`∞`-fibre residue sum**
  `∑_{a : F a = ∞} Res_a(α)` (Lemma 3.2 at `∞`, via the local-residue bridge);
* `finite_eq`: the total over the finite centers of the per-fibre trace residue equals the
  **finite-fibre residue sum** `∑_{y ≠ ∞} ∑_{a : F a = y} Res_a(α)` (Lemma 3.2 at the finite
  centers, via the local-residue bridge).

Each `*_eq` field is the honest geometric content of Miranda §VIII.3 (the trace residue = fibre sum
of residues); none is vacuous (see `formResidueTrace_of_holomorphic`). -/

(the output of the §VIII.3 trace assembly), the total residue of `α = ω₀·g` over its poles vanishes:

*Proof (complete).* The **general** trace combine `finiteResidueSum_trace_eq_zero_of_fibres'` (now
unconditional, the `ResidueChangeOfVariables` atom being discharged) gives
`(∑_{centers} Res_b(Tr_F α)) + Res_∞(Tr_F α) = 0`. By `finite_eq` and `infty_eq` the two summands
are the finite-fibre and `∞`-fibre residue sums; by `residueSum_eq_infty_add_finite` their sum is
the total residue, so it is `0`. -/

This is the precise statement Forster 17.3 needs: a globally-defined (coboundary) Mittag–Leffler
distribution has zero residue, which makes the residue functional `Res : H¹(X, Ω) → ℂ` well-defined
on cohomology classes (the node-4 `globalRes` descent).

The hypothesis `hpoles` records that `μ`'s bookkeeping pole set is the trace's pole set; combined

/-! ### Non-vacuity of `FormResidueTrace`

The `FormResidueTrace ω₀ g` obligations are genuine (true, satisfiable), not an impossible
hypothesis: in the case where `α = ω₀·g` is **globally holomorphic** (its chart-pullback coefficient
is analytic at every point — no poles) we exhibit a `FormResidueTrace ω₀ g` explicitly — the empty
`LaurentForm` (no poles, trace `≡ 0`) with an empty pole set, whose residue data and both fibre sums
vanish. This mirrors `Jacobians.ResidueTheoremX.logDerivTrace_of_div_eq_zero`, confirming the
isolated structure is honest (the residue theorem does hold in this case, with the trivial trace).
-/

/-- **Non-vacuity witness.**  When `α = ω₀·g` is globally holomorphic (`g`'s chart-pullback is
analytic at every point), a `FormResidueTrace ω₀ g` exists: an arbitrary cover `f`, the **empty pole
set** (so `residueSum ω₀ g ∅ = 0` directly), the empty `LaurentForm` (no monomials, `R ≡ 0`,
`Res_∞ = 0`), and vacuous fibre data.  Hence the `FormResidueTrace` obligations are *satisfiable* —
the structure is not a disguised `False`. -/
