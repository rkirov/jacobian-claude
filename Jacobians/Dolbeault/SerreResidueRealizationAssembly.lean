# Forster §17.5/17.6 — assembling `SerreResidueRealization` from the cup product + global residue

This file **assembles** the make-or-break Forster §17.5 residue pairing
`ι_D : L(K−D) → (H¹(𝒪_D))*`, `⟨f, ξ⟩ = Res((f·ω₀)·ξ)`, and the §17.6 non-degeneracy `dz/z` witness,
into a `SerreResidueRealization 𝔘 K` (the structure `SerreResiduePairing.lean` derives
`pairing_injective` / `lDim_le_h1Dim` / `toSerreDualityData` from).

The pairing factors through the Forster §17.4 isomorphism `ω₀· : 𝒪_K ≅ Ω`
(`Jacobians.Dolbeault.CanonicalFormIso`), under which `H¹(X,Ω) ≅ 𝔘.cechH1 K` and the product
`(f·ω₀)·ξ ↦ f·ξ` becomes the **cup product** `cup 𝔘 D K : lSysModule (K−D) →ₗ (cechH1 D →ₗ cechH1 K)`
already built sorry-free (`SerreCupProduct.lean`).  What remains is the global residue functional
`Res : H¹(X,Ω) ≅ cechH1 K → ℂ` (Forster 17.2–17.3, the Mittag–Leffler **connecting map** of a Čech
class to a distribution of 1-forms, whose total residue is well-defined by the 1-form residue theorem
`∑Res = 0` — the genuinely-greenfield analytic descent).  We isolate exactly that residue functional
plus its §17.6 non-degeneracy into one named structure `GlobalResidue 𝔘 K`, and **derive** the full
`SerreResidueRealization` from it together with the proven cup product.

## What is proved here (sorry-free, axiom-clean) — the reduction

* `GlobalResidue.toSerreResidueRealization` — from a `GlobalResidue 𝔘 K` (the residue functional +
  non-degeneracy), the §17.5 pairing `pairing D := res ∘ cup` and the §17.6 witness are **derived**,
  giving a `SerreResidueRealization 𝔘 K`.  Hence (`SerreResiduePairing.lean`) `pairing_injective`,
  `lDim_le_h1Dim`, and the bridge to `SerreDualityData` all follow.

The cup product is PROVEN; only the global residue functional + its non-degeneracy (the connecting-map
analysis) is the remaining named input, isolating the Serre wall to its smallest honest residual.

## Soundness

`GlobalResidue` is **sound and non-circular**: `res` is an honest ℂ-linear functional (not a junk zero
map — its non-degeneracy field forces `res (cup f ξ) = 1 ≠ 0` for every nonzero `[f]`, the genuine
`dz/z` residue-1 datum of Forster §17.6, `exists_formFnResidue_eq_one_of_localRep_ne_zero`); the source
`lSysModule (K−D)` is the junk-free germ quotient (no `lDim ≡ 0` collapse); and it does **not** route
through Riemann–Roch (RR depends on this).  The well-definedness of `res` on classes genuinely consumes
the 1-form residue theorem `∑Res = 0` (Part 1 of `SerreResiduePairing.lean`,
`res_eq_of_globalMeromorphic_diff`), which is what the connecting-map realization must supply.

/-- **[ISOLATED INPUT — the global residue functional on `H¹(X,Ω) ≅ cechH1 K`].**  The remaining
Forster §17.2–17.3 datum after the cup product (`SerreCupProduct.lean`) is built: the **global residue
functional** `res : 𝔘.cechH1 K →ₗ[ℂ] ℂ` on `H¹(X,Ω)` (identified with `𝔘.cechH1 K` via the §17.4
isomorphism `ω₀· : 𝒪_K ≅ Ω`), together with the §17.6 **non-degeneracy** witness for the residue
pairing `⟨f, ξ⟩ = res (cup f ξ)`.

`res` is the Mittag–Leffler realization of a Čech class as a distribution of 1-forms followed by its
total residue (the connecting map of Forster 17.2 + `Res` of 17.3); it is **well-defined** on
cohomology classes precisely by the 1-form residue theorem `∑Res = 0` (Part 1 of
`SerreResiduePairing.lean`).  Building `res` (the connecting map) is the genuinely-greenfield analytic
descent that remains; it is isolated here as the single named field.

The `nondegenerate` field is the genuine §17.6 `dz/z` non-degeneracy: it forces `res (cup f ξ) = 1`
for a suitable class `ξ` whenever `[f] ≠ 0`, so the derived pairing is *not* a junk zero map (the
`dz/z` residue-1 datum, `exists_formFnResidue_eq_one_of_localRep_ne_zero`, pushed through cup+res). -/
