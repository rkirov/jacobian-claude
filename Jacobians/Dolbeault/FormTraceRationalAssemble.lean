# `TraceRationalityWitness` from uniform trace agreement (Miranda §VIII.3 — the single deep
obligation)

`Jacobians.Dolbeault.FormTraceRationalReduce` reduced the `hL32` field of `TraceRationalityWitness`
to the per-finite-centre **trace agreement**, and isolated `infty_eq` as the remaining analytic
atom. `Jacobians.Dolbeault.FormTraceInftyFibre` then reduced `infty_eq` (in its proved
reciprocal-chart form) to the **reciprocal-chart trace agreement** over the pole fibre —
*structurally identical* to the finite case. This file assembles both: it produces the full
`TraceRationalityWitness` (and the residue theorem `∑Res=0`) from a **single uniform input** —
a rational `LaurentForm L` whose coefficient germ-agrees with the trace `Tr_F α` at *every* fibre
(finite charts at the finite centres, the reciprocal chart at `∞`).

This pins the entire remaining §VIII.3 wall to one precise, honest statement: the meromorphic trace
`Tr_F α` on the compact `ℂℙ¹` is **rational** — there is a `LaurentForm L` representing it
(germ-equal to it in every chart). Both residue conditions (`hL32` at the finite centres, `infty_eq`
at `∞`) then hold *by Lemma 3.2 at the respective fibre* (the proved `resAt_traceCoeff_fibreTrace` /
`resAt_traceCoeff_inftyFibreTrace`). Everything else in the chain to `∑Res=0` is proved,
axiom-clean.

## The single obligation, packaged

`TraceAgreementData ω₀ g f poles hac` bundles the honest §VIII.3 output:

* `L` — the rational `1`-form (the trace's partial-fraction expansion);
* `hcenters` — the `L`-centres are exactly the finite pole-values (discrete bookkeeping);
* `Dinf` — the `∞`-fibre enumeration (the poles of `α` over `∞`), an `InftyFibreData` whose `xs`
  enumerates `F⁻¹(∞) ∩ poles`;
* `hagree_fin` — `L.R` germ-agrees with the trace coefficient near each finite centre;
* `hagree_inf` — `recipCoeff L.R` germ-agrees with the `∞`-fibre trace coefficient near `0`.

The two `hagree_*` together are exactly "`L` represents `Tr_F α` on `ℂℙ¹`" (germ-equality in every
chart) — the rationality of the trace.

## What this file proves

* `traceRationalityWitness_of_agreementData` — the full `TraceRationalityWitness` from
  `TraceAgreementData`;
* `residueSum_eq_zero_of_agreementData` — the residue theorem `∑Res=0` from
  `TraceAgreementData`;
* `traceAgreementData_holomorphic` / `residueSum_eq_zero_holomorphic_via_agreementData` —
  **non-vacuity end-to-end**: in the empty-pole (globally-holomorphic) case the agreement data
  exists (empty `LaurentForm`, empty `∞` fibre), so the whole assembly is sound (not a disguised
  `False`).

## The minimal remaining obligation

the residue theorem `∑ₐ Resₐ(α) = 0` is now *unconditional modulo a single construction*:

> for a suitable adapted cover `f`, build a `TraceAgreementData ω₀ g f poles hac` — i.e. exhibit the
> rational `LaurentForm` representing `Tr_F α` and prove it germ-agrees with the trace in every
  chart.

This is the genuine §VIII.3 trace-rationality wall (the global meromorphic trace on compact `ℂℙ¹` is
rational; partial-fraction extraction + germ-agreement), the same fibre/sheet/branched-cover
apparatus as `exists_properMapDegree`. See the diagnosis in `FormTraceGlobalConstruct` /
`FormResidueTheorem`.

/-! ### The uniform trace-agreement datum (the single §VIII.3 obligation) -/

/-- **The trace-agreement datum** for an adapted cover: the honest §VIII.3 output that
`TraceRationalityWitness` reduces to. A rational `LaurentForm L` representing `Tr_F α` on `ℂℙ¹`,
together with the discrete centre bookkeeping and the **uniform germ-agreement** of `L` with the
trace in every chart (finite charts at the finite centres, the reciprocal chart at `∞`). Bundling
both residue conditions into agreement makes the remaining obligation a single statement: the trace
is rational. -/

    (poles : Finset X) (hac : AdaptedCover ω₀ g f poles) where

  /-- The `∞`-fibre enumeration: an `InftyFibreData` whose `xs` enumerates the poles of `α` over
  `∞`. -/

  coefficient (the honest "`L.R` is the partial-fraction expansion of `Tr_F α`" condition). -/

  `∞`-fibre trace coefficient (the honest Lemma-3.2-at-`∞` form). -/

/-! ### The full witness and the residue-theorem build from the agreement datum -/

/-- **`TraceRationalityWitness` from the uniform trace agreement.**  Given a `TraceAgreementData`
(the rational `L` + the centre bookkeeping + the `∞`-fibre enumeration + finite and reciprocal-chart
agreement), assemble the full `TraceRationalityWitness ω₀ g f poles hac`.

*Proof.* `hcenters` is passed through; the finite agreement gives `hL32` via the proved
`traceRationalityWitness_of_agree`; the reciprocal-chart agreement gives the reciprocal-chart
`infty_eq` (`resAt (recipCoeff L.R) 0 = ∑_{∞-fibre} Res`) via
`resAt_recipCoeff_eq_inftyResidueSum_of_agree`, which `traceRationalityWitness_of_agree_recip` lifts
to the `infty_eq` field through the proved bridge `resAtInfty_eq_resAt_recipCoeff`. -/

/-- **the residue-theorem build from the uniform trace agreement.** If an adapted cover and a
`TraceAgreementData` (the rational trace `L` germ-agreeing with `Tr_F α` in every chart) exist, then
the 1-form residue theorem `∑ₐ Resₐ(α) = 0` holds *unconditionally* for `α = ω₀·g`. This composes
`traceRationalityWitness_of_agreementData` with the proved `residueSum_eq_zero_of_adapted`. -/

    ∑ a ∈ poles, formFnResidue ω₀ g a = 0 :=
  residueSum_eq_zero_of_adapted hac (traceRationalityWitness_of_agreementData hac A)

/-! ### Non-vacuity of the agreement datum (end-to-end soundness)

In the globally-holomorphic (empty-pole) case the agreement datum exists — the empty `LaurentForm`
(no centres, `R ≡ 0`, `recipCoeff R ≡ 0`), the empty `∞` fibre, vacuous finite agreement, and the
reciprocal agreement `0 =ᶠ 0`.  This confirms the assembly is honest (satisfiable), not a disguised
`False`, and matches `traceRationalityWitness_holomorphic`. -/

/-- The empty `∞`-fibre datum (no `∞`-fibre poles): index `Empty`, vacuous regularity. -/

  hrecip_an := fun e => e.elim
  hrecip_deriv := fun e => e.elim
  hrecip_val := fun e => e.elim
  hg_mero := fun e => e.elim

/-- The `∞`-fibre trace over the empty fibre has trace coefficient `≡ 0` (empty sum). -/

  funext w
  show (∑ i : Empty, _) = (0 : ℂ)
  rw [Finset.univ_eq_empty, Finset.sum_empty]

/-- **`TraceAgreementData` non-vacuity.**  In the globally-holomorphic (empty-pole) case, a
`TraceAgreementData` exists for the empty `LaurentForm` and empty `∞` fibre: `hcenters` holds (both
sides empty), the finite agreement is vacuous, and the reciprocal agreement is
`recipCoeff 0 ≡ 0 =ᶠ 0` (the empty `∞`-trace coefficient). Hence the agreement-based assembly is
honest (satisfiable). -/

end-to-end).** In the empty-pole case, `residueSum_eq_zero_of_agreementData` applied to
`traceAgreementData_holomorphic` yields `∑_{a ∈ ∅} Res_a(α) = 0` — confirming the entire
uniform-agreement assembly produces a real `∑Res=0` (here trivially `0 = 0`). -/
