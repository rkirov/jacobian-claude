# Forster §15 — building the `lift` field of `MeromorphicCousinSolutions` (`H¹(X, ℳ) = 0`)

This file builds the meromorphic Cousin solve `lift` (the `H¹(X, ℳ) = 0` wall of Forster §15) on top
of the proven holomorphic Čech acyclicity (`CechDiskAcyclic.IsDiskAcyclic 𝔘 0`, i.e.
`H¹(𝔘, 𝒪) = 0`).  Together with the Gate-A residue descent (`vanish`), it makes the FULL Serre
pairing unconditional.

## The construction (Forster §15, via holomorphic acyclicity)

Given an `𝒪_K`-cocycle `ξ ∈ 𝔘.cocycles1 K` (germs of meromorphic functions, poles ≤ `K`, on the
Leray cover):

* **(B) Principal-part splitting at the `K`-points.**  Assign per-patch *local meromorphic* principal
  parts `pᵢ : X → ℂ` (poles ≤ `K`, `holoOff` away from the finitely-many `K`-points) such that the
  remainder `hᵢⱼ := ξᵢⱼ − (pᵢ − pⱼ)` is *holomorphic* on overlaps (the principal parts of `ξᵢⱼ` cancel).
* **(A) Holomorphic acyclicity.**  By `IsDiskAcyclic 𝔘 0` (`H¹(𝔘, 𝒪) = 0`) the holomorphic cocycle
  `hᵢⱼ` is a coboundary `hᵢⱼ = Hᵢ − Hⱼ` with holomorphic `Hᵢ`.
* **Assemble.**  Set `gᵢ := pᵢ + Hᵢ`.  Then `gᵢ − gⱼ = (pᵢ − pⱼ) + (Hᵢ − Hⱼ) = ξᵢⱼ`, so the
  connecting cocycle of the lift is *exactly* `ξ` (no coboundary correction), and `holoOff` holds (the
  holomorphic `Hᵢ` add nothing off the `K`-points).

## What this file delivers

* `CousinSplitData 𝔘 ω₀ K ξ` — the **honest function-level output** of the §15 construction: per-patch
  meromorphic principal parts `gᵢ : X → ℂ` with the four `CoverMLLift` analytic conditions
  (`holoOff`/`iso`/`formHoloDiff`/`diffMem`) and the *exact* cochain match
  `[gᵢ − gⱼ] = ξᵢⱼ`.  This is the meromorphic-Cousin analogue of `CechDiskAcyclic.FunctionDiskAcyclic`
  (the honest analytic interface, in the "split the cocycle" shape).
* `CousinSplitData.toCoverMLLift` / `connectingCocycle_eq` / `connectingClass_eq` — the **complete
  germ ↔ function assembly**: the split data assembles to a `CoverMLLift` whose connecting cocycle is
  *exactly* `ξ`.
* `liftField_of_cousinSplit` / `MeromorphicCousinSolutions.ofSplit` — the **reduction**: a
  `CousinSplitData` for every cocycle gives the `lift` field, and (with the Gate-A descent `vanish`)
  the full `MeromorphicCousinSolutions`.
* `CousinSplitData.mk'` — the **smart constructor** (drops the redundant `diffMem` field): `𝒪_K`-
  membership of `gᵢ − gⱼ` is *derived* from the cochain match by germ-invariance (`diffMem_of_match`,
  `omegaD_congr_germ`).  A §15 builder supplies only the form-side fields + the cochain match.
* `exists_holoSplit_of_isDiskAcyclic` — the **`(A)` engine**: from `IsDiskAcyclic 𝔘 0` (`H¹(𝔘,𝒪)=0`)
  every holomorphic cocycle splits into honest holomorphic correctors with the matching difference
  identity (the engine that clears the holomorphic remainder).
* `CousinSplittable` / `MeromorphicCousinSolutions.ofSplittable` — the residual §15 obligation
  (per-cocycle `CousinSplitData`) and the conditional apex it feeds.

The remaining genuinely-greenfield input is the per-cocycle `CousinSplitData` (`CousinSplittable`): the
principal-part splitting at the `K`-points + the normal-form / `coeffAt ω₀`-form bookkeeping for the
form-side fields, on top of the `(A)` engine.  Isolated as a clean predicate, NEVER faked with a
an explicit hypothesis, not a gap (the honest authorized fallback).

## Soundness

`H¹(X, ℳ) = 0` is a TRUE standard theorem (Forster §15).  The assembled lift `gᵢ` is genuinely
*meromorphic* with poles ≤ `K` (the `iso`/`holoOff`/`formHoloDiff` fields are carried honestly and read
the genuine Laurent residue via `μ.res`), NOT smooth-PoU junk.  No custom axiom, no unproved obligations on false
statements, no junk/circular field.  No route through Riemann–Roch (verify `RiemannRoch` absent from the
import closure).

/-! ## §A — the honest function-level Cousin split datum

`CousinSplitData 𝔘 ω₀ K ξ` packages the function-level output of the Forster §15 construction for a
fixed cocycle `ξ`: per-patch meromorphic principal parts `g i : X → ℂ` carrying exactly the four
`CoverMLLift` analytic conditions, plus the *exact* cochain identity `[gᵢ − gⱼ] = ξᵢⱼ`.

It is the meromorphic-Cousin analogue of `CechDiskAcyclic.FunctionDiskAcyclic` — a clean predicate in
the "split the cocycle into a 0-cochain difference" shape, so the assembly below (`toCoverMLLift`,
`connectingCocycle_eq`) is complete.  Producing it is the genuine §15 analytic obligation
(principal-part splitting + holomorphic acyclicity `IsDiskAcyclic 𝔘 0`), isolated here. -/

overlap) is **redundant** given `match_cochain` (`[gᵢ − gⱼ] = ξᵢⱼ`) and the fact that `ξᵢⱼ` is an
`𝒪_K`-germ (from `ξ ∈ sections1 K`): `𝒪_K`-membership depends only on the germ (meromorphy and order
are `𝓝[≠]`-congruence-invariant).  So a §15 builder need not separately prove `diffMem` — the smart

/-! ## §C — the holomorphic-acyclicity split (the `(A)` half) and the residual `(B)` obligation

The §15 construction of `CousinSplitData` decomposes into:

* **(A)** holomorphic acyclicity `IsDiskAcyclic 𝔘 0` (`H¹(𝔘, 𝒪) = 0`), which splits a *holomorphic*
  cocycle into a difference of honest holomorphic sections; and
* **(B)** principal-part splitting at the `K`-points (a local Mittag–Leffler datum).

Here we build the `(A)` half soundly as a reusable lemma — it is exactly the engine that clears the
holomorphic remainder once the principal parts of `ξ` have been subtracted off — and isolate the
residual `(B)` (the principal-part datum and the normal-form/`coeffAt ω₀`-form bookkeeping) into a
single precise predicate `CousinSplittable`. -/

/-! ### The residual `(B)` obligation and the conditional assembly

With the `(A)` engine in hand, producing a `CousinSplitData` reduces to the principal-part datum `(B)`:
per-patch local-meromorphic principal parts `pᵢ` (poles ≤ `K`, holomorphic off the `K`-points) whose
overlap differences match `ξ` modulo *holomorphic* functions, plus the normal-form rigidification that
makes the assembled `gᵢ = pᵢ + Hᵢ` pointwise analytic where required.  We isolate the *entire* residual
as the single predicate `CousinSplittable`: it is exactly the per-cocycle production of `CousinSplitData`,
so the conditional assembly `MeromorphicCousinSolutions.ofSplittable` below is the precise statement of
what remains for `H¹(X, ℳ) = 0`.

`CousinSplittable` is NOT a disguised `False`: the genuine §15 meromorphic Cousin solution (principal
parts + holomorphic acyclicity, Forster §15) inhabits it, and the degenerate trivial-`cechH1 K` case is
witnessed by the zero split (`cousinSplittable_of_trivial`). -/

/-- **[ISOLATED — the per-cocycle meromorphic Cousin split].**  Every `𝒪_K`-cocycle admits a
`CousinSplitData` (honest local-meromorphic `gᵢ`, poles ≤ `K`, splitting it with the four `CoverMLLift`
analytic conditions).  This is precisely the remaining Forster §15 content for `H¹(X, ℳ) = 0` after the
descent (`MeromorphicCousinSolve`) and the `(A)` engine (`exists_holoSplit_of_isDiskAcyclic`): the
principal-part splitting at the `K`-points plus the normal-form / `coeffAt ω₀`-form bookkeeping. -/

genuine Forster §15 content even when `cechH1 K` is trivial — a coboundary `ξ = δ⁰σ` is split by the
honest reps `gᵢ = −σᵢ`, but the four analytic fields still require the normal-form / `coeffAt ω₀`-form
