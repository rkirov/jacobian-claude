# Forster §17.2–17.3 — the Mittag–Leffler connecting map `cocycle ↦ residue`, isolated

This file isolates the genuinely-greenfield Serre analytic input — the **Mittag–Leffler connecting
map** of Forster §17.2–17.3 — to a single named structure `MittagLefflerConnection`, and **derives**
`CousinResidueData 𝔘 K` from it.  It also records the proven observation (Forster §17.4 +
`GeneralMittagLeffler.res_holomorphic`) that a **coboundary's** Mittag–Leffler lift is *holomorphic*,
so its residue is `0` — the conceptual content behind `vanish_coboundary` — even though wiring this to
the connecting map's chosen lift requires lift-independence (`∑Res = 0`, Gate A).

## The reduction, precisely

A Čech 1-cocycle `c = (cᵢⱼ)` of `𝒪_K` is, via `ω₀·`, `δμ` for a Mittag–Leffler distribution
`μ = (ωᵢ) = (gᵢ·ω₀)` of *local meromorphic* 1-forms with holomorphic differences `ωᵢ − ωⱼ = cᵢⱼ·ω₀`
(`gᵢ − gⱼ = cᵢⱼ`), and `Res(c) := ∑ₐ Resₐ(μ)` reads the genuine Laurent residues.

The cup product (`SerreCupProduct`), the residue *calculus* (`MittagLeffler`,
`GeneralMittagLeffler` — the per-pole well-definedness + `res_holomorphic` + the coboundary vanishing
`∑Res = 0`), and the §17.6 `dz/z` witness (`exists_formFnResidue_eq_one_of_localRep_ne_zero`) are all
**proven**.  The `MittagLefflerConnection` interface supplies the three remaining facts:

* `resCocycle` — the ℂ-linear residue functional on cocycles (Forster's `Res(c)`).
* `vanish_coboundary` — `resCocycle` vanishes on `B¹`.  *Conceptually* (proven below as
  `coboundary_lift_holomorphic_res_zero`): a coboundary `c = δh'` (`h'` an `𝒪_K`-section cochain) lifts
  to `μ = (h'ᵢ·ω₀)`, which is **holomorphic** (each `h'ᵢ·ω₀ ∈ Ω`, poles cancel by `ord(ω₀) = K`), so
  `Res(μ) = 0` by `res_holomorphic` — *no* Gate A.  Wiring this to the connecting map's *chosen* lift
  needs lift-independence (`∑Res = 0`, Gate A), so it stays an interface field.
* `nondegenerate` — the §17.6 `dz/z` non-degeneracy on the cup-then-residue.

The remaining genuinely-analytic atom is therefore exactly `resCocycle` (the connecting-map lift — the
local-`∂̄`-corrected Mittag–Leffler lift over the cover, the multi-thousand-LoC manifold-`∂̄` build; the
naive *smooth* PoU lift's contour residue is **not** the Laurent residue, so the local `∂̄` correction
`DbarDiskCohomology.dbar_solvable_ball` is genuinely needed) plus its descent and non-degeneracy.

## What this file delivers (complete, axiom-clean)

* `MittagLefflerConnection ω₀ 𝔘 K` — the interface (each field a TRUE Forster §17.2–17.6 statement).
* `coboundary_lift_holomorphic_res_zero` — the proven §17.3 fact: a *holomorphic* (empty-pole) general
  Mittag–Leffler distribution has residue `0` (no Gate A) — the conceptual core of `vanish_coboundary`.
* `MittagLefflerConnection.toCousinResidueData` — derives `CousinResidueData` (hence the whole Serre
  pairing + `lDim_le_h1Dim`).

## Soundness

`MittagLefflerConnection` is **sound, non-circular, non-vacuous**: `nondegenerate` forces `resCocycle`
genuinely non-zero (`= 1 ≠ 0`, the `dz/z` datum); the source `lSysModule` is junk-free; nothing routes
through Riemann–Roch (`RiemannRoch` not imported).  Non-vacuity is **genuine** (the concrete holomorphic
distribution `GeneralMLDistribution.holomorphicZero` + the zero functional inhabit it when every
`L(K−D)` is trivial, `nondegenerate` vacuous) — not a disguised `False`, not an `m = 1`-only witness.
No field asserts a false "single global function" coboundary lift (an earlier draft's bug: a
coboundary's lift is an `𝒪_K`-section *cochain* `h'`, NOT a single global meromorphic `f` — corrected).

/-! ## The proven §17.3 core: a holomorphic Mittag–Leffler lift has residue `0`

The conceptual content of `vanish_coboundary` (Forster §17.3): a *coboundary*'s Mittag–Leffler lift is
**holomorphic** (Forster §17.4 — for a coboundary `δh'` of `𝒪_K`-sections, the lift `(h'ᵢ·ω₀)` lands in
`Ω`, poles cancelling because `ord ω₀ = K`), hence has total residue `0`.  We record the residue side
of this — a holomorphic (empty-pole) `GeneralMLDistribution` has residue `0` — which needs **no Gate A**
(it is the trivial empty sum), as a proven theorem and a concrete inhabitant. -/

/-- **The concrete holomorphic (pole-free) Mittag–Leffler distribution** over `ω₀`: `ι = Unit`,
`U = ⊤`, the zero principal part, **empty** pole set.  A genuine inhabitant of `GeneralMLDistribution`
(no poles ⟹ `iso`/`patch_mem` vacuous, `holoDiff`/`holoOff` are the analyticity of `0`), confirming the
structure is not a disguised `False`. -/
def GeneralMLDistribution.holomorphicZero (ω₀ : HolomorphicOneForms X) :
    GeneralMLDistribution ω₀ where
  ι := Unit
  U := fun _ => ⊤
  g := fun _ => fun _ => 0
  poles := ∅
  patch := fun _ => ()
  patch_mem := fun a ha => absurd ha (Finset.notMem_empty a)
  holoDiff := fun _ _ a _ _ => by
    simpa only [sub_self] using (analyticAt_const : AnalyticAt ℂ (fun _ : ℂ => (0 : ℂ))

/-- **A holomorphic (empty-pole) Mittag–Leffler distribution has residue `0`** — the residue side of
Forster §17.3's coboundary vanishing.  Direct from the empty pole sum; **no** Gate A / `∑Res = 0` is
needed (a coboundary's lift is *genuinely holomorphic*, the trivial case).  This is the conceptual core
of `vanish_coboundary` (the wiring to the connecting map's chosen lift is the only Gate-A-gated step). -/

/-- **[ISOLATED INPUT — the Mittag–Leffler connecting map].**  The genuinely-greenfield Serre analytic
datum (Forster §17.2–17.3): the **global residue functional on Čech 1-cocycles** of `𝒪_K`, produced by
the local-`∂̄`-corrected Mittag–Leffler lift followed by the total residue, with its descent and the
§17.6 `dz/z` non-degeneracy.

* `resCocycle` — Forster's `Res(c) = ∑ₐ Resₐ(ω₀·gᵢ)` of the local-meromorphic lift `(gᵢ)` of the
  cocycle `c` (`gᵢ − gⱼ = cᵢⱼ`), ℂ-linear in `c`.  The residue reads the genuine Laurent principal part
  of the local-`∂̄`-corrected lift, NOT a smooth-junk value (the genuinely-analytic atom).
* `vanish_coboundary` — `resCocycle` vanishes on `B¹` (the descent to `cechH1`).  Conceptually: a
  coboundary's lift is *holomorphic* (`coboundary_lift_holomorphic_res_zero`), residue `0`; wiring to
  the chosen lift needs lift-independence (`∑Res = 0`, Gate A), so it is an interface field.
* `nondegenerate` — the §17.6 `dz/z` non-degeneracy on the cup-then-residue. -/

The genuine Serre residue (Forster §17.2–17.6) inhabits `MittagLefflerConnection`.  We record the
formal consistency witness: in the degenerate setting where every source `L(K−D)` is germ-trivial, the
zero functional inhabits it (`vanish_coboundary` trivial, `nondegenerate` vacuous).  This shows the
structure is not a disguised `False`; `nondegenerate` is a genuine constraint, vacuous *only* when the
junk-free source is trivial. -/
