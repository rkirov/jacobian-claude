  ∂̄-solvability on a disk (full-ball solvability) and the disk-acyclicity it produces.

  The first Dolbeault rung `DbarLocal.dbar_solvable_locally` solves `∂̄u = g` only on a
  *neighborhood* of a point.  Here we upgrade to solvability on a whole **ball** `ball c r`:
  because the *closure* of a bounded ball is compact, a single smooth cutoff `χ` that equals `1`
  on `closedBall c r` already has compact support, so the compactly-supported atom
  `DbarDisk.dbar_solvable_of_compactSupport` solves `∂̄u = χ·g` globally, and `χ·g = g` on the ball.
  No Mittag-Leffler exhaustion is needed — boundedness of the ball does the work.

  `dbar_holo_splitting_ball` is the Čech↔Dolbeault dictionary on a ball: a *holomorphic*
  difference `f = h₂ - h₁` of smooth functions whose `∂̄`s agree can be re-split as a
  *holomorphic* difference of *holomorphic* functions, by solving `∂̄u = ∂̄h₁` on the
  ball (`dbar_solvable_ball`) and subtracting `u`.  This is the local engine behind
  `H¹(disk, 𝒪) = 0`.  The `∂̄ = 0 ⇒ holomorphic` direction is supplied by the Wirtinger
  characterisation `differentiableAt_complex_iff_differentiableAt_real`.

/-- **∂̄-solvability on a ball (full-disk solvability).** For `g : ℂ → ℂ` smooth on all of `ℂ` and
any ball `ball c r` (`r > 0`), there is a smooth `u : ℂ → ℂ` with `∂̄u = g` on `ball c r`.

Proof: take a smooth bump `χ` with `χ.rIn = r`, `χ.rOut = r + 1`, so `χ ≡ 1` on the *compact*
`closedBall c r ⊇ ball c r` and `χ` has compact support.  The product `χ·g` is smooth with compact
support, so `DbarDisk.dbar_solvable_of_compactSupport` gives a global smooth `u` with `∂̄u = χ·g`
everywhere; on `ball c r` the cutoff is `1`, so `∂̄u = g` there.

Strictly stronger than the local rung `DbarLocal.dbar_solvable_locally` (it solves on the *whole*
ball, not just a neighborhood of the center).  The crucial point making this elementary — no
exhaustion — is that a bounded ball has *compact* closure, so a single compactly-supported cutoff
suffices. -/

/-- **Holomorphic re-splitting on a ball (the Čech↔Dolbeault dictionary).**
Suppose `f = h₂ - h₁` on a ball `ball c r`, with `h₁, h₂` smooth and `f` *holomorphic* on the ball
(equivalently `∂̄h₁ = ∂̄h₂` there).  Then `f` is also a difference `g₂ - g₁` of functions that are
each *holomorphic* on the ball: solve `∂̄u = ∂̄h₁` on the ball (`dbar_solvable_ball`, since
`∂̄h₁` is smooth), and set `gᵢ = hᵢ - u`; then `gᵢ` is holomorphic (`∂̄gᵢ = ∂̄hᵢ - ∂̄u = 0`,
`differentiableAt_of_dbar_eq_zero`) and `g₂ - g₁ = h₂ - h₁ = f`.

This is the local engine of `H¹(disk, 𝒪) = 0`: a smooth Čech splitting of a holomorphic cocycle
can be corrected to a *holomorphic* splitting. -/
