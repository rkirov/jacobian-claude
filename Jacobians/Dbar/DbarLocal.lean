  Local ∂̄-solvability — the first rung of the Dolbeault comparison (the kernel of
  the `D = 0` Serre-duality input).

  From the compactly-supported ∂̄-solvability atom `DbarDisk.dbar_solvable_of_compactSupport`
  (the Cauchy transform, proven axiom-clean in `DbarDisk.lean`), we deduce that *any* smooth
  `g : ℂ → ℂ` can be ∂̄-solved on a neighborhood of an arbitrary point: multiply `g` by a
  smooth cutoff `χ` (a `ContDiffBump`) that equals `1` near `z₀` and has compact support, solve
  the compactly-supported problem for `χ · g`, and restrict to the inner ball where `χ ≡ 1`.

  Main result: `DbarLocal.dbar_solvable_locally`.

/-- **Local ∂̄-solvability (the first Dolbeault rung).**  Any smooth `g : ℂ → ℂ` can be
∂̄-solved on an open neighborhood `V` of an arbitrary point `z₀`: there is a smooth `u` with
`∂̄u = g` on `V`.

Proof: cut off `g` by a smooth bump `χ` that is `1` near `z₀` and compactly supported, solve the
compactly-supported equation `∂̄u = χ·g` everywhere via `DbarDisk.dbar_solvable_of_compactSupport`,
and observe `χ·g = g` on the inner ball `V` where `χ ≡ 1`. -/
