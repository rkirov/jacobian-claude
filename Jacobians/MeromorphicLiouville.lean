# Compact Liouville for meromorphic functions (non-Dolbeault)

A non-constant meromorphic function on a compact connected Riemann surface must have a pole.
This is the meromorphic corollary of holomorphic Liouville
(`MDifferentiable.exists_eq_const_of_compactSpace`): if `f` had no pole, then in every chart its
order is `≥ 0`, so `f` is (a removable-singularity repair of) a holomorphic function; on a compact
connected manifold that forces it to be constant, whence its order is `≡ 0`, contradicting
non-constancy.

## The removable-singularity repair

The repo's `MeromorphicFunction.toFun : X → ℂ` is only pinned up to its germ off each point: at an
isolated removable singularity it may carry an arbitrary "junk" value. Mathlib's order-based limit
theory (`tendsto_nhds_of_meromorphicOrderAt_nonneg`) shows that wherever the order is `≥ 0` the
function has a genuine limit along the punctured neighborhood. We therefore work with the
**limit repair**

  `holoRepr f x := limUnder (𝓝[≠] x) f.toFun`,

which discards the junk: it agrees with the normal-form representative
(`toMeromorphicNFAt`) in every chart, hence is analytic in every chart, hence globally
`MDifferentiable`. No manual gluing of per-chart germs is needed — the single global definition
`holoRepr` is analytic at every point by a per-chart computation.

/-! ### A chart-independent characterization of "order `≥ 0`"

`orderAtPoint f x` is *defined* via the chart `chartAt x`, so comparing it to the order of the
pullback `f.toFun ∘ φ.symm` in a different chart `φ` needs chart-invariance of the order. We avoid
the (currently unproved) `orderAtPoint_chart_invariant` by characterizing nonnegativity of the order
in a manifestly chart-independent way: **`f` has a limit along the punctured neighborhood `𝓝[≠] x`**
(Mathlib `tendsto_nhds_iff_meromorphicOrderAt_nonneg`). Transferring a `Tendsto` statement through a
chart homeomorphism is elementary. -/

/-- An open partial homeomorphism carries the punctured neighborhood of a source point to the
punctured neighborhood of its image: `Tendsto φ (𝓝[≠] x) (𝓝[≠] (φ x))` for `x ∈ φ.source`.
(Continuity gives the unpunctured limit; injectivity on the source removes the center.) -/

/-- **[INPUT — compact Liouville (no Dolbeault)] PROVEN.** A non-constant meromorphic function on a
compact connected Riemann surface has a pole. Contrapositive: with no pole every order is `≥ 0`, so
the limit-repair `holoRepr` is globally holomorphic (`mdifferentiable_holoRepr`); by holomorphic
Liouville on the compact connected `X` (`MDifferentiable.exists_eq_const_of_compactSpace`) it is
constant, forcing every order to be `0` (`orderAtPoint_eq_zero_of_holoRepr_const`) — contradicting
non-constancy. -/
