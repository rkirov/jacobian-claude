For a space charted on `ℂ`: given an open set `U ∋ y` and a finite
obstruction set `C` — where `y` may itself lie in `C` — there is a point
`z ∈ U \ C` joined to `y` by a path inside `U`. The construction perturbs
`y` inside a small ball-chart around `y` to a point `z` whose chart image
is close to `(chartAt ℂ y) y` but not in the chart-image of the finite set
`C`; the path is the pull-back of a straight segment in the chart ball,
which lives entirely in the chart source `⊆ U`. -/

**Full chart-overlap avoidance for a `ChartedSpace ℂ Y`.**

If `Y` is a charted space modelled on `ℂ`, `U` is open with `y ∈ U`, and
`C : Set Y` is finite (no assumption that `y ∉ C`), there exists `z ∈ U`
with `z ∉ C` and a path from `y` to `z` lying entirely in `U`.

Construction: take a ball-chart `φ'` at `y` (`ChartRestrictionToBall`), shrink
its source to land inside `U`, then perturb `(chartAt ℂ y) y` along a straight
segment in the chart ball whose pulled-back endpoint avoids `C`. Such a
segment exists because the finite chart-image of `C` blocks at most finitely
many directions through the centre.
