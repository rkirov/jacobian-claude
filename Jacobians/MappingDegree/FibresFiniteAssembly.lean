/-! # Full assembly: `fibres_finite_statement` modulo a single connectivity hypothesis

This file composes the reduction chain for `Degree.fibres_finite_statement`:

* `Degree.lean`: `fibres_finite_of_all_fibers_isDiscrete` reduces the
  statement to per-fibre `IsDiscrete`.
* `AnalyticFiberDiscrete.lean`: `fibres_finite_of_chart_pullback`
  reduces it further to a per-fibre-point `ChartPullbackData`.
* `ContMDiffOmegaAnalytic.lean`: the bridge
  `ContMDiffAt 𝓘(ℂ) 𝓘(ℂ) ω f x → AnalyticAt ℂ` on chart pullbacks.
* `AnalyticContinuationGlobalization.lean`: the within-chart globalisation
  of "not eventually constant" via the identity theorem.
* `ChartPullbackDataConstruction.lean`:
  `chartPullbackData_of_contMDiff_global` builds `ChartPullbackData` from
  `ContMDiff … ω f` plus a per-fibre-point local non-degeneracy hypothesis.

The single remaining input is the **connectivity-globalization** step,
packaged as `ConnectivityGlobalizationHypothesis`: from "`f` is not (globally)
constant" on a connected `X`, derive "for every fibre point `x`, the chart
pullback of `f` is not eventually equal to its value at `(chartAt ℂ x) x`" —
the analytic-continuation argument across charts. -/

/-! ## Connectivity-globalization hypothesis

The single input taken as a hypothesis-parameter here: for every
non-constant `C^ω` map between (connected) complex manifolds, the chart
pullback near every fibre point is not eventually equal to its target
chart-value. Equivalently, "`f` non-constant globally" implies "the chart
pullback of `f` is not eventually constant at any fibre point". -/

/-! ## Assembly

The proof composes `chartPullbackData_of_contMDiff_global` (the connectivity
hypothesis into a `ChartPullbackData` at every fibre point) with
`fibres_finite_of_chart_pullback`. -/

/-- **Full assembly: `fibres_finite_statement` from the connectivity-
globalization hypothesis.** Given `ConnectivityGlobalizationHypothesis X Y`,
the classical statement `fibres_finite_statement X Y` holds. -/

/-! ## Discharge restated against `fibres_finite_statement`

We export the assembly as a direct conditional discharge of
`fibres_finite_statement`: under the connectivity hypothesis, the statement
holds. -/

/-- **Conditional discharge.** `fibres_finite_statement X Y` holds whenever the
connectivity-globalization hypothesis holds. Equivalent to
`fibres_finite_of_connectivity_hypothesis` but stated as a one-line
implication for ergonomic downstream use. -/
