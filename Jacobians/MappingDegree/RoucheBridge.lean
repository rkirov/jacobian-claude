/-! # The Rouché bridge: argument principle ⟹ local preimage count

This file discharges the **Rouché bridge** statements named (but left inert) in
`LocalNormalForm.lean`:

* `argumentPrinciple_implies_rouche_statement k g`
  (`= argumentPrinciple_disk_statement k g → localMultiplicity_eq_order_punctured_statement k g`)
* `localMultiplicity_eq_order_punctured_statement k g` itself (the Rouché count)
* `localMultiplicity_eq_localOrder_statement X` (the manifold-level count)

## What the bridge says

For `g : ℂ → ℂ` analytic at `0` with `analyticOrderAt g 0 = k` and `k ≥ 1`, the
equation `g z = w` has **exactly `k` solutions** in a small punctured disk around
`0`, for every nonzero `w` sufficiently close to `0`. Classically this is the
argument principle: applying `(2πi)⁻¹ ∮ (g-w)'/(g-w)` to `g - w` counts the
zeros of `g - w` (all simple, since `(g-w)' = g' ≠ 0` off the order-`k` zero of
`g`), giving `k`.

## How it is proven here

The disk argument-principle integral identity itself is proven, axiom-clean, in
`ArgumentPrincipleDiskProof.lean` (`argumentPrinciple_disk_statement_holds`). The
*count* `localMultiplicity_eq_order_punctured_statement` is the downstream
consequence. Rather than re-derive the open-mapping "exactly `k` simple zeros"
passage from the integral, we observe that the very same count is **already
proven, complete and axiom-clean**, by the k-th-root substitution route in
`LocalKFoldMultiplicityFullyUnconditional.lean`
(`localKFoldMultiplicity_preimage_card`): the substitution
`z ↦ (z - x₀)·u(z)^{1/k}` puts a bijection between the `k`-fold preimage and the
`k` distinct `k`-th roots of `w - w₀`. (The brief sanctions this route as the
"cleaner" alternative to re-deriving via the integral.)

So the planar bridge `argumentPrinciple_implies_rouche_statement` is discharged by
producing its conclusion outright (the hypothesised disk integral is not needed,
because the conclusion is independently a theorem). The two planar `*_statement`
defs are thereby turned from inert placeholders into proven facts.

## The manifold-level statement is misformalized

The manifold-level `localMultiplicity_eq_localOrder_statement X` (target 2) is
**false as stated** and cannot be completely discharged. Its only hypotheses are
`MMeromorphicOn 𝓘 f univ` and `∀ x, order ≠ ⊤`; the chart-pullback meromorphy
constrains only the germ of `f` on the *punctured* neighborhood of `x`, leaving
the value `f x` completely free (junk-value gap). But the statement centers its
target neighborhood `V` at `f x` and counts `{y ∈ U | f y = w}` over `w ∈ V \
{f x}`, which forces `f x = 0` (the value the function takes by continuity at an
order-`≥ 1` zero).

Concrete counterexample: `X = ℂ`, `f z = z` for `z ≠ 0`, `f 0 = 5`. Then `f` is
meromorphic at `0` (`z ↦ z • f z` agrees with `z²` on a *full* neighborhood, so is
analytic), `localOrder f 0 = 1 > 0`, yet `f 0 = 5 ≠ 0`. For `w` near `5` the only
solution of `f y = w` is `y = w ≈ 5`, which lies outside any small `U ∋ 0`, so the
count is `0 ≠ 1`. The statement fails.

Fixing the inert def to add `f x = 0` (or continuity of `f` at `x`) requires an
edit to `LocalNormalForm.lean`, which is outside this file's scope. We therefore
land the **honest theorem**: the count under the value-normalization `f x = 0`.

## Status

* `localMultiplicity_eq_order_punctured_statement_holds` — proven, no gaps
  (target 1, planar Rouché count).
* `argumentPrinciple_implies_rouche_statement_holds` — proven, no gaps
  (target 1, the named planar bridge).
* `chartRepr_analytic_order_of_apply_eq_zero` — proven, no gaps
  (target 2, ℂ-analytic core of the manifold count).
* `kFold_count_radiusBounded` — proven, no gaps
  (radius-bounded planar count, needed for the chart transport).
* `localMultiplicity_eq_localOrder_count_of_apply_eq_zero` — proven, no gaps
  (target 2, the honest manifold count under `f x = 0`; the chart-transport of the
  planar count).
* `localMultiplicity_eq_localOrder_statement X` itself — NOT discharged: false as
  stated (see above); the inert def is left untouched.

/-! ## Target 1: the planar Rouché count -/

/-- **The Rouché preimage count `localMultiplicity_eq_order_punctured_statement`,
discharged.**

For `g : ℂ → ℂ` analytic at `0` with `analyticOrderAt g 0 = k` and `k ≥ 1`, there
exist `ε > 0` and a neighborhood `V` of `0` such that for every nonzero `w ∈
ball 0 ε`, the equation `g z = w` has exactly `k` solutions in `V \ {0}`.

Proof: route through the proven k-th-root count
`localKFoldMultiplicity_preimage_card` with `w₀ := g 0 = 0`
(the value at an order-`≥ 1` zero) and `x₀ := 0`. The order hypothesis transfers
because `g - g 0 = g` (as `g 0 = 0`), and the set shapes agree because `0` is
never in the fiber over a nonzero `w` (`g 0 = 0 ≠ w`). -/

The named bridge `argumentPrinciple_disk_statement k g →

independently a theorem (`localMultiplicity_eq_order_punctured_statement_holds`),
so the hypothesised disk integral is not needed to derive it. (The disk integral
identity itself is the genuine analytic atom and is proven separately in

/-! ## Target 2: the manifold-level count — analytic core (under `f x = 0`)

The manifold-level statement `localMultiplicity_eq_localOrder_statement` counts
the manifold fiber `{y ∈ U | f y = w}` for a meromorphic `f : X → ℂ` near a point
`x` of positive local order.

A genuine subtlety blocks the statement *as written* (see the file header /
report): `MMeromorphicAt I f x` constrains only the germ of `f` on the *punctured*
neighborhood of `x`, leaving the value `f x` completely free. The statement,
however, centers its target neighborhood `V` at `f x` and counts over `w ∈ V \
{f x}`; this forces `f x = 0` (the value the function *would* take by continuity
at an order-`≥ 1` zero). For a pathological `f` with `f x ≠ 0` the count drops to
`0` for `w` near `f x`, so the statement is false. The honest theorem therefore
carries `f x = 0` as a hypothesis (the continuity-compatible normalization).

This section lands the **ℂ-analytic core** of that honest theorem, completely:
under `f x = 0`, the chart representative `g := f ∘ chart⁻¹` is genuinely analytic
at `c := chart x`, vanishes there, and has analytic order exactly
`(localOrder I f x).natAbs`. From this, the planar Rouché count
(`localKFoldMultiplicity_preimage_card`) applies to `g`
directly; the only remaining step to the full manifold statement is the
topological transport of the count along the chart homeomorphism (which needs a
radius-bounded variant of the planar count so the chart ball sits inside
`chart.target`). -/

/-- **Analytic core of the manifold count (under `f x = 0`).**

For `f : X → ℂ` meromorphic at `x` with positive local order and `f x = 0`, the
chart representative `g := f ∘ (chartAt ℂ x).symm` is analytic at `c := chartAt ℂ
x x`, vanishes there, and has analytic order exactly `(localOrder I f x).natAbs`.

This packages the value/order facts the planar Rouché count needs. The key inputs
are `AnalyticAt.of_meromorphicOrderAt_pos` (positive meromorphic order + zero
value ⟹ analytic) and `AnalyticAt.meromorphicOrderAt_eq` (meromorphic order is the
`ℤ`-cast of the analytic order). -/

/-! ### Radius-bounded planar k-fold count

The full manifold transport needs the planar count to take place in a disk that
fits inside `chart.target`. We therefore re-derive the fully-unconditional planar
count with an extra radius bound `ε ≤ R`, by threading `R` through the `k = 1`
radius-bounded count `localMultiplicityOne_preimage_card_with_radius`. This mirrors
`localKFoldMultiplicity_preimage_card_of_substitution` verbatim except for passing
`min ρ R` to the inverse-function-theorem radius. -/

/-! ## Target 2: the full manifold count (under `f x = 0`)

We now assemble the honest manifold-level count: under `f x = 0`, the chart
homeomorphism transports the radius-bounded planar count into the manifold fiber
count, giving the `localMultiplicity_eq_localOrder_statement` conclusion. The
`X, I, f, x` binders are the same ones declared above. -/

/-- **Manifold-level local multiplicity count (the honest `f x = 0` form).**

For `f : X → ℂ` meromorphic at `x` with positive local order and `f x = 0`, there
exist an open `U ∋ x` and an open `V ∋ f x` such that for every `w ∈ V` with
`w ≠ f x`, the manifold fiber `{y ∈ U | f y = w}` has exactly `(localOrder I f
x).natAbs` elements.

This is the genuine content of R3 (`localMultiplicity_eq_localOrder_statement`),
with the value-normalization `f x = 0` that the chart-pullback meromorphy does not
itself supply. The proof: the chart representative `g := f ∘ chart⁻¹` is analytic
at `c := chart x` with `g c = 0` of order `(localOrder).natAbs`
(`chartRepr_analytic_order_of_apply_eq_zero`); the radius-bounded planar count
(`kFold_count_radiusBounded`) gives the disk fiber count inside a ball
`ball c ε ⊆ chart.target`; the chart homeomorphism (`InjOn`, `left_inv`,
`map_source`) transports it to the manifold fiber. -/
