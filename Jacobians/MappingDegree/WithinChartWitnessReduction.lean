/-! # Reducing `WithinChartWitnessHypothesis` to a per-chart non-constancy hypothesis

`ConnectivityGlobalizationReduction.lean` (ZZ32) reduced
`ConnectivityGlobalizationHypothesis X Y` to
`WithinChartWitnessHypothesis X Y`. That hypothesis is *existential* on a
preconnected open `U ⊆ ℂ` plus a witness point `z₁`, and packages the
analyticity of the chart pullback on `U` in addition to a value-difference
witness.

This file isolates the genuinely classical content into a strictly smaller,
strictly different-shaped hypothesis: **per-chart non-constancy in every
neighborhood**. Concretely:

* For every non-constant `C^ω` map `f : X → Y` and every fibre point `x` of
  `y₀`, in every neighborhood of the chart image `(chartAt ℂ x) x`, the chart
  pullback takes a value other than the chart image of `f x`.

The analyticity half of the within-chart witness is now supplied
unconditionally via ZZ24 (`contMDiff_omega_analyticAt_chart_pullback`,
`Manifold/ContMDiffOmegaAnalytic.lean`): an `AnalyticAt` statement gives, by
`AnalyticAt.eventually_analyticAt` plus `Metric.eventually_nhds_iff`, an open
ball on which the pullback is `AnalyticOnNhd`. Open balls in `ℂ` are convex,
hence preconnected.

The preconnected-open `U` and the analyticity package are *derived*; the
caller need only provide the per-chart non-constancy. The shape is strictly
smaller because:

1.  It eliminates the existential `(U, z₁)` pair entirely (the caller
    quantifies over arbitrary neighborhoods `V` of the chart image and
    produces a value-witness in `V`).
2.  It does not mention `IsPreconnected`, `AnalyticOnNhd`, or any
    chart-pullback analyticity datum. The analyticity is supplied
    automatically from `ContMDiff … ω` via ZZ24.

The remaining *honest* obstruction (path-walking analytic continuation
across charts to derive per-chart non-constancy from global
`¬ IsConstantMap f`) is unchanged and remains the same parameter-input as
before.

No gaps, no `axiom`. -/

/-! ## Auxiliary: `AnalyticAt` ⇒ preconnected open ball of analyticity -/

/-- **`AnalyticAt` provides a preconnected open neighborhood of analyticity.**
If `F : ℂ → ℂ` is `AnalyticAt ℂ` at `z₀`, then there exists an open ball
around `z₀` on which `F` is `AnalyticOnNhd ℂ`. Open balls in `ℂ` are convex
hence preconnected.

The proof uses `AnalyticAt.eventually_analyticAt` to extract analyticity on
a neighborhood, and `Metric.eventually_nhds_iff` to pin down a metric ball
inside that neighborhood. -/

/-! ## The per-chart non-constancy hypothesis -/

/-- **Per-chart non-constancy hypothesis.** For every non-constant `C^ω` map
`f : X → Y` and every fibre point `x` of every `y₀ : Y`, the chart pullback
of `f` takes a value other than the chart image of `f x` in every
neighborhood of the chart image of `x`.

This is strictly weaker (and strictly different in shape) than
`WithinChartWitnessHypothesis`: the caller does not need to provide a
preconnected open `U`, an analyticity statement, or a specific witness
point. The analyticity of the chart pullback on a small open ball around
the chart image follows from ZZ24 (`contMDiff_omega_analyticAt_chart_pullback`);
the witness point `z₁` is extracted as a value-difference inside that ball. -/

/-! ## Reduction: per-chart non-constancy ⇒ within-chart witness -/

/-- **Reduction.** The per-chart non-constancy hypothesis implies the
within-chart witness hypothesis. The proof:

1. Get analyticity of the chart pullback at `(chartAt ℂ x) x` from ZZ24.
2. Extract a preconnected open ball `U = Metric.ball ((chartAt ℂ x) x) r`
   on which the pullback is `AnalyticOnNhd`, via
   `exists_preconnected_open_ball_of_analyticAt`.
3. The ball `U` is in `𝓝 ((chartAt ℂ x) x)` (it is open and contains the
   centre); apply per-chart non-constancy at `V := U` to extract a witness
   `z₁ ∈ U` with `F z₁ ≠ c`. -/
