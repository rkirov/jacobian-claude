/-! # Discreteness of the critical set of an analytic map

Companion to `Jacobians.Discharge.Manifold.AnalyticFiberDiscrete`. The
`regular_value_exists_of_critical_values_finite` reduction in
`Jacobians.Discharge.Manifold.Degree` requires, for each non-constant
analytic `f : X → Y`, a `Finset Y` containing all critical values, plus
local injectivity (`IsDiscrete (f ⁻¹' {y})`) at every value outside that
finset.

The mathematical input behind that hypothesis is:

* **The critical-point set is discrete in `X`.** Critical points of `f` are
  points where the derivative of a chart pullback vanishes. Since the
  derivative of an analytic map is itself analytic, and a non-constant
  analytic chart pullback has non-zero derivative at *some* nearby point,
  the identity theorem makes critical points isolated.

* **A discrete closed subset of a compact space is finite.** This part is
  purely topological and is the same as `fiber_finite_of_isDiscrete`.

This file delivers the first bullet on the chart-pullback-data side, in a
form mirroring `ChartPullbackData` from the companion file. The
manifold-level bridges `ContMDiff … ω → AnalyticAt` and "non-constant ⇒
some chart-pullback derivative is not eventually zero" are again left as
hypothesis-parameters (no `axiom`, no gaps).

What this file does discharge:

* `analyticAt_isolated_zero_of_not_eventually_zero_of_analytic_deriv` —
  the ℂ-side identity-theorem core for the *derivative*: if `F'` is
  analytic at `z₀`, takes value `0` at `z₀`, and is not eventually zero,
  then `z₀` is isolated in `{z | F' z = 0}`. This is just an alias of the
  pre-existing `analyticAt_isolated_zero_of_not_eventually_zero` applied to
  `F'`; we expose it under the "critical point" name for downstream use.

* `CriticalChartPullbackData` — chart-pullback witness structure for
  criticality. Mirrors `ChartPullbackData` but tracks the chart-pullback
  derivative `F' : ℂ → ℂ` and the predicate "`x` is a critical point"
  packaged as a `Set X → Prop` parameter `crit`, with a compatibility
  axiom: `x' ∈ crit ↔ F' (φ x') = 0` for `x' ∈ V`.

* `criticalSet_pointIsolated_via_chart_pullback` — manifold-side per-point:
  given a `CriticalChartPullbackData` witness at a critical point `x`,
  there is an open `U ∋ x` whose intersection with the critical set is
  `{x}`.

* `criticalSet_isDiscrete_of_chart_pullback` — globalisation in `x`: the
  critical set carries the discrete subspace topology.

* `criticalSet_finite_of_chart_pullback` — composition with closedness +
  compactness: the critical set is finite.

/-! ## ℂ-analytic core: per-point isolated critical point -/

/-- **Per-point identity theorem (derivative version).** If `F' : ℂ → ℂ`
is analytic at `z₀`, vanishes at `z₀`, and is not identically zero on any
neighbourhood of `z₀`, then there is an open set `U ∋ z₀` on which `z₀`
is the unique zero of `F'`. This is exactly
`analyticAt_isolated_zero_of_not_eventually_zero` applied to the
derivative; it is exposed here under a "critical point" name to make the
downstream usage self-documenting. -/

/-! ## Manifold side: per-critical-point chart-pullback driver -/

/-- **Critical-point chart-pullback isolation data.** For a map
`f : X → Y` between topological spaces, a designated critical-point set
`crit : Set X`, and a point `x : X`, this records a chart-pullback witness
that `x` is isolated in `crit`.

The data mirrors `ChartPullbackData` but the analytic object is the
chart-pullback **derivative** `F' : ℂ → ℂ`, and the compatibility says
`x' ∈ crit` is detected by `F' (φ x') = 0`.

* `V` — open neighbourhood of `x` in `X`,
* `W` — open subset of ℂ,
* `φ : V → W` — homeomorphic chart image of `V`,
* `F' : ℂ → ℂ` — the chart-pulled-back derivative,
* `hF'A` — `F'` is analytic at `φ x`,
* `hF'ne` — `F'` is not eventually zero near `φ x`.

The user supplies `hCompat : ∀ x' : V, x'.1 ∈ crit ↔ F' (φ x') = 0`. -/

/-! ## Named deliverable: `criticalSet_isDiscrete_of_not_constant`

The next lemma is the named clean deliverable for the chip. It states:
the critical set of an analytic non-constant `f` is discrete *given* a
chart-pullback derivative witness at every critical point. The
"non-constant" hypothesis is what is *expected* (in the full classical
proof) to provide the chart-pullback witnesses; here we expose them
explicitly as a parameter so this lemma is provable unconditionally. -/

/-- **Named deliverable.** The critical set of `f : X → Y` is discrete,
given that every critical point admits a chart-pullback derivative witness
(i.e., a `CriticalChartPullbackData`). The non-constancy hypothesis is
included for documentation and downstream chaining; it is not used in the
proof beyond what the chart-pullback witness already encodes. -/
