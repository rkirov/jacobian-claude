/-! # Globalising "not constant" to "not eventually constant" via the identity theorem

Companion to `Jacobians.MappingDegree.AnalyticFiberDiscrete`. ZZ22 reduced
the discreteness statement to a per-fibre-point chart-pullback condition (the
chart-pulled-back representative of `f` should be analytic and **not eventually
equal to `c`** at the chart image, where `c` is the chart image of `y₀`). This
file discharges the "not eventually constant" half of that condition from the
genuinely classical hypothesis "`f` is non-constant", in the cases where the
classical mathlib identity-theorem can be applied directly: namely, on a single
connected open set in `ℂ` (i.e. **within one chart**).

The full manifold-level globalisation across chart overlaps requires walking
the analytic-continuation argument along a path in `X` and is left as a
hypothesis-parameter, with what is still open documented at the end of this
file.

What this file *does* discharge:

* `eventuallyEq_const_iff_eqOn_of_preconnected` — local re-statement of
  mathlib's `AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq` against a
  constant function: an analytic function on a connected open set is eventually
  equal to a constant `c` at one point iff it equals `c` everywhere on the set.

* `not_eventually_const_of_not_constOn` — the immediate contrapositive: if `F`
  is analytic on a preconnected open set `U`, takes a value other than `c`
  somewhere in `U`, and `z₀ ∈ U`, then `F` is not eventually `c` at `z₀`.

* `chart_pullback_not_eventually_const_within_chart` — the local-within-one-chart
  version of the deliverable: if the chart-pullback `F : ℂ → ℂ` is analytic on a
  preconnected open set `U` that contains the chart image `z₀` of `x` and also
  some other point `z₁` whose `F`-value differs from `c`, then the chart pullback
  is not eventually equal to `c` at `z₀`. This is exactly the `hFne` hypothesis
  in `ChartPullbackData`.

* `chart_pullback_not_eventually_const_of_witness` — packaging of the previous
  lemma against `¬ IsConstantMap f` together with a chart-witness: if `f` is
  non-constant *as observed inside the chart* (i.e., the chart pullback takes a
  value other than `c` somewhere on the connected chart domain `U`), then the
  pullback is not eventually `c` at the chart image of any `x ∈ U`.

What this file does **not** do (still open for full manifold globalisation):

* Walking analytic continuation along a path in a connected complex manifold
  `X` to get from "`f` non-constant on `X`" to "the chart pullback at every
  fibre point is non-constant on its chart". The standard argument is:

      pick `x₁, x₂ ∈ X` with `f x₁ ≠ f x₂` (exists by `¬ IsConstantMap f`),
      pick a path γ : [0,1] → X from any candidate `x` to one of `x₁, x₂` whose
        chart pullback witnesses non-constancy,
      cover γ([0,1]) by finitely many charts and chain
        `eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq` across overlaps.

  This requires `PathConnectedSpace X` (which follows from
  `ConnectedSpace + LocallyPathConnectedSpace`, the latter true for manifolds)
  plus the chart-overlap analyticity bridge. The path-walking step is plain
  topology once the chart-overlap analyticity is in hand, but the
  chart-overlap analyticity itself is deferred by ZZ24 (the `ContMDiff … ω →
  AnalyticAt` bridge on chart pullbacks). Until ZZ24 lands, the within-one-chart
  version is the right granularity for this file.

* `hU_pc` — `U` is preconnected,
* `z₁ ∈ U` — a witness point inside the chart where the pullback differs from `c`.

`z₁` plays the role of "non-constancy is observed inside this chart". The
existence of such a `z₁` is the in-chart version of `¬ IsConstantMap f`.

/-! ## Composition with `AnalyticFiberDiscrete`

We provide a single composition lemma that, given a within-one-chart
non-constancy witness for every fibre point, produces the `hFne` argument
required by `ChartPullbackData`. The chart-domain `U`, the analytic
representative `F`, and the target chart-value `c` are bookkept by the
witness; the consumer only needs to plug `z₀` (the chart image of the fibre
point) into the resulting `¬ ∀ᶠ` statement.

This is the maximal local-only deliverable: it does *not* claim to derive the
witness from `¬ IsConstantMap f` globally — that step requires walking
analytic continuation across charts, which is deferred.

function that to every fibre point `x ∈ f ⁻¹' {y₀}` associates a chart

/-! ## Documentation: full manifold globalisation, what is still open

Let `X, Y` be connected complex manifolds and `f : X → Y` analytic and
non-constant. To produce a `FibreChartNonConstAssignment`, we need: for every
`x ∈ f ⁻¹' {y₀}`, a connected chart of `X` around `x` together with a
witness point `z₁` in that chart's image where the chart pullback differs
from `c := chart_Y(y₀)`.

The argument is:

1.  By `¬ IsConstantMap f`, pick `x* : X` with `f x* ≠ y₀`.
2.  By connectedness of `X`, there is a path γ from `x` to `x*`.
3.  Cover γ([0,1]) by finitely many connected charts. In the chart containing
    `x*`, the chart pullback takes value `chart_Y(f x*) ≠ chart_Y(y₀)` at the
    chart image of `x*`. So there is a witness `z₁` in that chart.
4.  In the chart containing `x`, suppose for contradiction that the chart
    pullback is identically `c` on the whole chart domain `U_x` (this is the
    "eventually constant" case extended via mathlib's identity theorem to
    "constant on `U_x`"). Walk along γ via overlapping charts: on each
    overlap, the chart pullbacks agree up to chart-transition (this is where
    ZZ24's `ContMDiff … ω → AnalyticAt` bridge is needed), so by the identity
    theorem the pullback is constant on the next chart's domain too. By
    finiteness of the cover we reach the chart containing `x*` and conclude
    the pullback is constant there — contradicting step 3.

Step 4 requires:

    (a) the chart-transition maps are `AnalyticOn` ℂ on overlaps (mathlib,
        for `IsManifold 𝓘(ℂ) ω`);
    (b) the chart pullback in any chart is `AnalyticOnNhd` on the chart
        domain (this is **ZZ24**, the `ContMDiff … ω → AnalyticAt` bridge);
    (c) chart overlap is open and connected after intersecting with a path
        tube, which is plain topology.

(a) is in mathlib at the pin (analytic structure on `IsManifold … ω`); (c) is
plain topology; (b) is deferred by ZZ24. Once ZZ24 lands, the path-walking step
is straightforward and produces a `FibreChartNonConstAssignment` from
`¬ IsConstantMap f` plus connectedness, completing the manifold-level
globalisation.

Until ZZ24 lands, packaging the witness as a parameter (which is what
`FibreChartNonConstAssignment` does) is the right granularity: it isolates
the locally-derivable identity-theorem content (this file) from the
chart-overlap analyticity content (ZZ24).
