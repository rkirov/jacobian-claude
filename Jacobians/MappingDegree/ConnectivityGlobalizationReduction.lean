/-! # Reducing `ConnectivityGlobalizationHypothesis` to a within-chart witness hypothesis

`FibresFiniteAssembly.lean` (ZZ30) reduced
`fibres_finite_statement X Y` to a single hypothesis:
`ConnectivityGlobalizationHypothesis X Y`. That hypothesis is *filter-shaped*
("not eventually equal to a constant"), and its only known proof requires
walking analytic continuation along a path in `X`.

This file provides a **strictly smaller, strictly different-shaped** hypothesis
that suffices: for every non-constant `C^ω` map `f : X → Y` and every fibre
point `x` of every `y₀`, there exists a *concrete witness*

* an open preconnected set `U ⊆ ℂ` containing the chart image
  `(chartAt ℂ x) x`, together with
* a witness point `z₁ ∈ U` whose value under the chart pullback differs from
  the chart image of `f x`.

Crucially, in addition we ask that the chart pullback be `AnalyticOnNhd ℂ` on
`U`. This is the *honest* obstruction: ZZ24 (`ContMDiff … ω → AnalyticAt`
bridge on chart pullbacks) is not yet landed at this pin, so the analyticity
half is still parameter-input.

The shape is genuinely smaller because:

1.  It is *existential* (provide a `(U, z₁)` pair) rather than the original's
    *universal* filter statement (no constant-eventually).
2.  `U` need not be the entire chart domain — any preconnected open superset of
    `{(chartAt ℂ x) x, z₁}` inside the chart's image suffices.
3.  The "not eventually `c`" filter conclusion is *derived* from the witness
    via the classical identity theorem
    (`AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq`), which is in
    mathlib at the pin and is exactly what
    `not_eventually_const_of_not_constOn` packages.

Therefore: `WithinChartWitnessHypothesis X Y → ConnectivityGlobalizationHypothesis X Y`,
and by composition with `fibres_finite_statement_holds_of_connectivity` (ZZ30),
also `WithinChartWitnessHypothesis X Y → fibres_finite_statement X Y`.

This is a *partial reduction*, not a discharge: the within-chart witness still
encodes "non-constancy is observed *in this fibre point's chart*" which, in
general, requires path-walking from a globally non-constant pair `(x', f x' ≠
y₀)` into the chart of `x`. But the new hypothesis isolates the path-walking
to a clean existence-of-witness statement in `ℂ`, separate from the filter
statement. Whoever discharges this hypothesis only needs to produce a
concrete chart-relative pair `(U, z₁)`; they no longer need to talk about
eventually-equal filters or the identity theorem at all.

No gaps, no `axiom`. -/

/-! ## The within-chart witness hypothesis -/

/-- **Within-chart witness hypothesis.** For every non-constant `C^ω` map
`f : X → Y` and every fibre point `x` of every `y₀ : Y`, there exists an open
preconnected set `U ⊆ ℂ` containing the chart image of `x`, on which the
chart pullback of `f` is `AnalyticOnNhd`, plus a witness `z₁ ∈ U` whose chart
pullback value differs from `(chartAt ℂ (f x)) (f x)`.

This hypothesis is strictly weaker (and strictly different in shape) than
`ConnectivityGlobalizationHypothesis`: that one quantifies a filter
("not eventually equal"); this one provides an explicit `(U, z₁)` pair from
which the filter statement is derived via the classical identity theorem. -/

connectivity-globalization hypothesis. The proof is a direct application of
`not_eventually_const_of_not_constOn` (the classical identity-theorem
contrapositive in this file's companion). -/
