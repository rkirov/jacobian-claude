/-! # Discharging the chart-ball off-centre witness from "not eventually constant"

ZZ36 (`PerChartNonConstancyReduction.lean`) reduced
`PerChartNonConstancyHypothesis X Y` to `ChartBallOffCentreWitnessHypothesis X Y`.
That hypothesis asks, for every non-constant `C^ω` map `f`, every fibre point
`x` of `y₀ = f x`, and every radius `r > 0`, to exhibit a single point
`z₁ ∈ Metric.ball ((chartAt ℂ x) x) r` at which the chart pullback differs
from its value at the chart image of `x`.

This file (ZZ38) provides the **identity-theorem witness extractor**: given
that the chart pullback `F : ℂ → ℂ` is analytic at `z₀ = (chartAt ℂ x) x`
(true under `ContMDiff … ω` by ZZ24) and that `F` is **not** eventually equal
to `F z₀` near `z₀`, every metric ball around `z₀` contains an off-centre
point at which `F` differs from `F z₀`.

The mechanism is the mathlib dichotomy
`AnalyticAt.eventually_eq_zero_or_eventually_ne_zero`: either `F - F z₀` is
eventually zero near `z₀` (excluded by hypothesis) or `F - F z₀ ≠ 0` on a
punctured neighborhood, hence on every small enough metric ball minus `z₀`.

What this file *does* discharge:

* `AnalyticAt.exists_off_centre_value_ne` — pure-ℂ extractor: from analyticity
  at `z₀` and "not eventually `F z₀`" produce, for every `r > 0`, a point
  `z ∈ Metric.ball z₀ r` with `F z ≠ F z₀`. The `z` is automatically off-centre
  since `F z ≠ F z₀` rules out `z = z₀`.

* `chartBallOffCentreWitness_of_chart_pullback_not_eventually_const` —
  manifold-side: discharges `ChartBallOffCentreWitnessHypothesis X Y` from the
  hypothesis-parameter that for every non-constant `C^ω` map and every fibre
  point, the chart pullback is **not eventually equal** to its centre value at
  the chart image. That hypothesis-parameter is the same content already
  consumed by `chart_pullback_not_eventually_const_of_witness` in
  `AnalyticContinuationGlobalization.lean`.

The remaining obstruction is the bridge from `¬ IsConstantMap f` to "chart
pullback at every fibre point is not eventually `chartAt _ y₀ y₀`" — the
manifold-level analytic-continuation step, unchanged by this file.

No gaps, no `axiom`. -/

/-! ## ℂ-analytic core: off-centre witness from "not eventually constant" -/

/-- **Off-centre witness in any small ball.** If `F : ℂ → ℂ` is analytic at
`z₀` and is *not* eventually equal to `F z₀` near `z₀`, then every metric
ball around `z₀` of positive radius contains a point at which `F` differs
from `F z₀`.

Mechanism: the mathlib dichotomy
`AnalyticAt.eventually_eq_zero_or_eventually_ne_zero` applied to
`G z := F z - F z₀` rules out the "eventually zero" branch by hypothesis,
leaving `G ≠ 0` (i.e., `F z ≠ F z₀`) on a punctured neighborhood. Any open
ball is itself a neighborhood of `z₀`, so it intersects that punctured
neighborhood non-trivially. -/

/-! ## Chart-pullback hypothesis-parameter -/

/-- **Chart-pullback non-eventual-constancy hypothesis.** For every
non-constant `C^ω` map `f : X → Y`, every fibre point `x` of every `y₀`,
the chart pullback `F = (chartAt ℂ (f x)) ∘ f ∘ (chartAt ℂ x).symm` is **not
eventually equal** to `(chartAt ℂ (f x)) (f x)` at the chart image
`(chartAt ℂ x) x`.

This is the manifold-side hypothesis-parameter that bridges
`¬ IsConstantMap f` to per-chart non-constancy of the pullback. The
within-one-chart version of this bridge is supplied by
`chart_pullback_not_eventually_const_of_witness` in
`AnalyticContinuationGlobalization.lean`; the manifold-globalization step
across chart overlaps is deferred elsewhere and is not the subject of this file. -/

/-! ## Manifold-side discharge -/

/-- **Discharge of `ChartBallOffCentreWitnessHypothesis`.** From the
chart-pullback non-eventual-constancy hypothesis-parameter and the
ℂ-analyticity of chart pullbacks (ZZ24), every chart ball around the chart
image of a fibre point contains an off-centre value witness.

Proof: the chart pullback is analytic at `z₀ = (chartAt ℂ x) x` by ZZ24
(`contMDiff_omega_analyticAt_chart_pullback`). Combined with the hypothesis
"`F` is not eventually `F z₀`" (rewritten via the chart-left-inverse identity
`F z₀ = (chartAt ℂ (f x)) (f x)`), the ℂ-side extractor
`AnalyticAt.exists_off_centre_value_ne` produces a witness in any ball. -/
