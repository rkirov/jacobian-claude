/-! # Local multiplicity invariance — the `k = 1` (biholomorphic) case

This file proves the **`k = 1` slice** of the topological local-multiplicity
theorem (the "branched holomorphic degree" combinatorial fact):

> Let `g : ℂ → ℂ` be analytic at `x₀ : ℂ` with `g(x₀) = w₀` and
> `deriv g x₀ ≠ 0` (i.e. local multiplicity exactly `1`). Then there exist
> `ε > 0` and `δ > 0` such that for every `w ∈ ball w₀ δ` with `w ≠ w₀`,
> the equation `g z = w` has *exactly one* solution in `ball x₀ ε`.

In the language of branched-cover degree theory, this is the statement that
near a regular point (one with non-vanishing derivative), the analytic map
`g` is locally a homeomorphism onto an open set, so each value near `w₀` has
exactly one preimage in the chosen neighborhood.

## Status

* **`k = 1` proof**: complete, no gaps, no `axiom`. Routes through the
  **inverse function theorem** (`HasStrictFDerivAt.toOpenPartialHomeomorph`).
* **`k ≥ 2`**: not in this file. The general case requires the argument
  principle / Rouché theorem, which is not packaged at the mathlib pin
  `8e3c989` (15 April 2026); see the discussion in
  `Jacobians.Discharge.Manifold.LocalNormalForm` (the `Prop`-valued statement
  `localMultiplicity_eq_order_punctured_statement`, the
  `argumentPrinciple_disk_statement` named gap, and the trivial `k = 0`
  theorem `argumentPrinciple_disk_zero_case` that *is* discharged).

## Why a separate file

The companion file `LocalNormalForm.lean` already proves *injectivity* of
`g` on a neighborhood of a regular point
(`MMeromorphicAt.localMultiplicity_one_locally_injective`). The contribution
here is to upgrade that injectivity statement to the **explicit ε–δ
preimage-count form** used in the brief: for every value `w` close to (but
not equal to) `w₀`, the preimage set in a *specified* `ball x₀ ε` has
*exactly one* element.

## Main result

* `localMultiplicityOne_preimage_card`: the headline ε–δ count for `k = 1`.

## Proof sketch

1. Lift `AnalyticAt` to `HasStrictDerivAt` (via
   `AnalyticAt.hasStrictDerivAt`).
2. With non-vanishing derivative, repackage as `HasStrictFDerivAt` with a
   `ContinuousLinearEquiv` derivative
   (`HasStrictDerivAt.hasStrictFDerivAt_equiv`).
3. The inverse function theorem (`HasStrictFDerivAt.toOpenPartialHomeomorph`)
   yields an `OpenPartialHomeomorph φ` realising `g` as a homeomorphism from
   an open neighborhood of `x₀` onto an open neighborhood of `w₀`.
4. Pick `ε > 0` small enough that `ball x₀ ε ⊆ φ.source`
   (`IsOpen.mem_nhds` on the source).
5. Pick `δ > 0` small enough that `ball w₀ δ ⊆ φ.target` *and*
   `φ.symm '' (ball w₀ δ) ⊆ ball x₀ ε` (via continuity of `φ.symm` at `w₀`).
6. For `w ∈ ball w₀ δ \ {w₀}`, the unique solution to `g z = w` in
   `φ.source` is `φ.symm w ∈ ball x₀ ε`, and by `φ.injOn` no other
   `z ∈ φ.source` solves it; in particular no other `z ∈ ball x₀ ε ⊆ φ.source`
   does. Therefore the preimage has cardinality exactly `1`.

/-- **Local multiplicity invariance, `k = 1` case.**

For `g : ℂ → ℂ` analytic at `x₀` with `deriv g x₀ ≠ 0`, there exist
`ε, δ > 0` such that for every `w` in `ball (g x₀) δ` with `w ≠ g x₀`, the
preimage set `{z ∈ ball x₀ ε | g z = w}` has exactly one element.

This is the order-`1` slice of the general "preimage count = local
multiplicity" theorem: when the local multiplicity is `1`, each nearby
value has a single preimage.

The proof routes through the inverse function theorem packaged as an
`OpenPartialHomeomorph` (`HasStrictFDerivAt.toOpenPartialHomeomorph`). -/

/-- **Variant with `closedBall x₀ R` analyticity hypothesis.**

This is the `k = 1` form of the brief's stated theorem (which gives an
analyticity hypothesis on a closed ball of radius `R`). It follows from
`localMultiplicityOne_preimage_card` because `AnalyticOnNhd ℂ g
(closedBall x₀ R)` implies `AnalyticAt ℂ g x₀` (when `0 < R`, so `x₀` lies in
the closed ball).

The hypothesis "`g(z) ≠ w₀` for `z ∈ closedBall x₀ R \ {x₀}`" from the brief
is the *isolation-of-the-w₀-fiber* condition, which is automatic at `k = 1`
(local injectivity from non-vanishing derivative); we therefore do not need
it as a separate hypothesis here. The general `k ≥ 2` version (not in this
file) does require either the isolation hypothesis or the order-from-below
hypothesis. -/
