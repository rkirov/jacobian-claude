/-! # Path-connected ⇒ preconnected reduction for the finite-puncture
case (ZZ159, scope-reduced)

For a connected complex 1-manifold `Y`, the complement of any finite set
is preconnected. This is the standard "go around the puncture" fact —
content `(M1)`: the path-connectedness of `Cᶜ` for finite `C` on a
connected 2-manifold.

`(M1)` itself is **not in mathlib at the project pin**
(`8e3c989104daaa052921bf43de9eef0e1ac9fbf5`, lean v4.30.0-rc1). The
relevant ambient lemma — `Set.Countable.isPathConnected_compl_of_one_lt_rank`
in `Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Module.Connected` — gives this for normed
ℝ-spaces of real rank ≥ 2 but does not lift through a chart structure.
A genuine manifold proof needs (a) local path-connectedness of `Y` from
`ChartedSpace ℂ Y` (mathlib's `ChartedSpace.locPathConnectedSpace` —
present, but as a theorem requiring `[LocPathConnectedSpace H]`) plus
(b) the chart-by-chart "go around" routing — not present.

This file therefore lands the **reduction-only headline**: given the
unproven manifold-lift `h_path` (`(M1)`), preconnectedness of the finite
complement follows. Downstream consumers (`ZZ160`) instantiate `h_path`
either via the missing manifold-lift content (when present) or — for
the strict-closure path of items 8/9/22/24 — re-package as an explicit
named hypothesis on the closure theorem.

No gaps, no `axiom`. -/
