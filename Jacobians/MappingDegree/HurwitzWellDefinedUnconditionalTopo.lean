/-! # Hurwitz constant-card with unconditional topology (ZZ176)

Compose ZZ160's `fibre_card_well_defined_at_regular_holds_of_h_path`
(post-ZZ172, corrected) with ZZ165's
`isPathConnected_compl_finite_of_connected_chartedSpace_complex`
(unconditional path-connectedness of finite-complement subsets of a
connected complex 1-manifold) to discharge the topological residual
without any assumption.

The remaining residual is the **per-`f` analytic packaging** `h_pkg`:

```
∀ f : X → Y, ContMDiff 𝓘(ℂ) 𝓘(ℂ) ω f → ¬ IsConstantMap f →
  ∃ C : Set Y, C.Finite ∧
    (∀ w : RegularValueWitnessReg f, w.toWitness.value ∈ (Cᶜ : Set Y)) ∧
    IsLocallyConstant (fun y : (Cᶜ : Set Y) ↦ (f ⁻¹' {y.val}).ncard)
```

This packaging encapsulates the analytic content that is genuinely owed at
this mathlib pin: a finite critical-value set `C` (analytic identity
theorem), and locally-constant fibre cardinality on its complement
(local-triviality of the regular-value covering — Hurwitz local normal
form, ZZ151/152, lifted by ZZ169).

No gaps, no `axiom`. -/

/-- **Hurwitz constant-card, unconditional topology (ZZ176).**

Discharge of the corrected `fibre_card_well_defined_at_regular_statement`
that takes only the analytic per-`f` packaging — the topological
path-connectedness residual is supplied unconditionally from ZZ165.

When `h_pkg` lands (analytic identity theorem for the `C.Finite` leg, plus
ZZ151/152/169 chain for `IsLocallyConstant`), this theorem is one rewrite
away from strict closure of `Degree` item 3.reg. -/
