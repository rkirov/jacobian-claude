/-! # Fibre cardinality is locally constant from a Hurwitz-style patching package

Given `f : X → Y` and a *target point* `y₀ : Y` whose preimage `f ⁻¹' {y₀}`
admits a finite "Hurwitz patching package" `HurwitzPatchingData`:

* a finite indexing of the preimage `xs : Finset X` with `↑xs = f ⁻¹' {y₀}`;
* for each `x ∈ xs`, an open neighbourhood `U x` of `x`;
* the `U x` are pairwise disjoint;
* for each `x ∈ xs`, an open set `V x` of `Y` containing `y₀` such that
  `f` maps `U x` into `V x`, is *injective* on `U x`, and is *surjective*
  from `U x` onto `V x`;
* a *covering neighbourhood* `W` of `y₀` with `W ⊆ V x` for every `x ∈ xs`,
  satisfying `f ⁻¹' W ⊆ ⋃ x ∈ xs, U x` (every preimage of a point in `W`
  lies in one of the sheets).

Then for **every** `y ∈ W`, the fibre `f ⁻¹' {y}` has cardinality
`xs.card = (f ⁻¹' {y₀}).ncard`.

This is the *patching* content of the classical "regular value of a non-constant
analytic map between Riemann surfaces ⇒ fibre count is locally constant" fact.
The hypothesis `HurwitzPatchingData` is exactly what `analytic_local_normal_form`
(`k = 1` at a regular value) plus the inverse function theorem deliver
when packaged across all preimages of `y₀` and the local sheets are intersected.

/-- **Hurwitz patching package** for `f : X → Y` at a target point `y₀ : Y`.

Bundles the data needed to conclude that `f` is, in a topological neighbourhood
of `f ⁻¹' {y₀}`, a disjoint union of `xs.card` homeomorphic sheets onto a
common neighbourhood of `y₀`. From this, the cardinality of `f ⁻¹' {y}` is
constant for `y` near `y₀` (and equals `xs.card`). -/
