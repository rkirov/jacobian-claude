/-! # `LocalSheetData` from a `RegularValueWitnessReg` (zzLSD)

This file packages the existing point-builder
`LocalSheetData.ofContMDiffMfderivNeZero`
(`Manifold/LocalSheetDataFromContMDiff.lean`, ZZ169) with the regular-value
witness bundle `Jacobians.Discharge.ContMDiff.RegularValueWitnessReg`
(`Manifold/Degree.lean`).

The regular-value-witness structure already carries, as a field
(`is_regular`), exactly the chart-pullback-derivative-nonzero certificate
consumed by `ofContMDiffMfderivNeZero`. So the supplier here is a
one-step composition: pull `h_deriv` out of `w.is_regular` at the given
preimage point and feed it into the ZZ169 builder.

This is the supplier feeding the `h_sheets` hypothesis of
`Jacobians.Discharge.fibreCard_isLocallyConstant_on_compl_of_localSheets`
(`Manifold/HLcUnconditional.lean`) on the regular-value side of any
`Cᶜ` decomposition where `C` contains the critical values.

## Anti-cheat

* No `axiom`, no gaps.
* No signature changes to any pre-existing definition.
* No new mathlib imports (transitively available via the two local imports).
