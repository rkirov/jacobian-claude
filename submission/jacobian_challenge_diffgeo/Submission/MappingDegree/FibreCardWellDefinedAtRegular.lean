/-! # Composition: Hurwitz local-constancy + preconnected regular subset
⇒ `fibre_card_well_defined_at_regular_statement`

Compose `fibre_card_well_defined_on_regular_subset_holds_of_locallyConstant`
with a per-`f` packaging of the regular subset `R` and its analytic
locality + topological connectedness, into
`fibre_card_well_defined_at_regular_statement X Y`.

This file is the structural glue: the two analytic hypotheses
(locally-constant ncard on the regular subset, the chart-pullback-deriv
content) plug in via the packaged shape this file consumes.  The witness
type `RegularValueWitnessReg f` carries no `C : Set Y` parameter — its
regularity certificate is intrinsic to `f`. -/

/-- **Hurwitz constant fibre-cardinality from a locally-constant
preconnected packaging.** Conditional on a packaged existence (for every
non-constant analytic `f`) of a regular-value subset
`R ⊆ Y` carrying:

* support: every regular witness's value lies in `R`,
* locally-constant ncard on `R` (analytic / covering-space content),
* preconnected `R` (topological content).

Conclude the unfolded form of `fibre_card_well_defined_at_regular_statement X Y`.

Stated in the unfolded `∀ f hf hnc w₁ w₂, w₁.card = w₂.card` shape rather
than against the def, to avoid `intro`-time elaboration "typeclass instance
problem is stuck" issues observed when applying the def directly. The
underlying statement is identical (the def's body). -/
