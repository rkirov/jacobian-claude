/-! # Path-connected ⇒ preconnected reduction for the finite-puncture case

For a connected complex 1-manifold `Y`, the complement of any finite set
is preconnected. This is the standard "go around the puncture" fact: the
path-connectedness of `Cᶜ` for finite `C` on a connected 2-manifold.
Mathlib's `Set.Countable.isPathConnected_compl_of_one_lt_rank` gives this
for normed ℝ-spaces of real rank ≥ 2 but does not lift through a chart
structure, so this file states the reduction: given the manifold-lift
`h_path` (path-connectedness of the finite complement), preconnectedness
follows. -/

preconnected — the shape consumed by `RegularSubsetPreconnected.lean`. -/
