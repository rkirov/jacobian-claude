/-! # Proving `ClopennessOfLocallyConstHypothesis`

`ChartOverlapPropagationDischarge.lean` reduced the chart-overlap
propagation hypothesis to a single residual analytic-continuation
statement: the locally-constant locus
`S = {x | ∀ᶠ x' in 𝓝 x, f x' = y₀}`
of any `C^ω` map onto a fixed value `y₀` is closed.

This file proves that statement via the local identity theorem
applied chart-by-chart, with no path-walking.

## The argument

Take `x ∈ closure S`.

1. `S ⊆ f ⁻¹' {y₀}` (by `locallyConstLocus_apply`), and `f` is continuous,
   `Y` is `T2`, so `f ⁻¹' {y₀}` is closed and contains the closure of `S`.
   Hence `f x = y₀`.

2. With `f x = y₀`, the target chart `chartAt ℂ (f x) = chartAt ℂ y₀`. By
   the chart-pullback bridge, the chart pullback
   `F := (chartAt ℂ (f x)) ∘ f ∘ (chartAt ℂ x).symm`
   is `AnalyticAt ℂ` at `(chartAt ℂ x) x`; take a
   preconnected open ball `B = Metric.ball ((chartAt ℂ x) x) r` on which
   `F` is `AnalyticOnNhd ℂ`.

3. Pulling back `B` through the chart and intersecting with the open
   neighbourhoods on which `chartAt ℂ x` is defined and `f` lands in
   `(chartAt ℂ y₀).source`, we obtain an open neighbourhood of `x` in `X`.
   Since `x ∈ closure S`, that neighbourhood meets `S`. Pick a witness
   `x' ∈ S` inside it.

4. `x' ∈ S` gives an open `W ∋ x'` with `f ≡ y₀` on `W`. On
   `W ∩ (chartAt ℂ x).source`, we have
   `F z = (chartAt ℂ y₀) y₀` for every `z ∈ (chartAt ℂ x) '' (W ∩ source)`,
   and a small ball around `(chartAt ℂ x) x'` lies in that image, giving
   `F =ᶠ[𝓝 ((chartAt ℂ x) x')] (fun _ => (chartAt ℂ y₀) y₀)`.

5. Apply `AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq` against the
   constant on `B`: `F` equals `(chartAt ℂ y₀) y₀` on all of `B`. In
   particular `F` is constant on the open ball `B ∋ (chartAt ℂ x) x`, so
   pulling back to `X` we get an open neighbourhood of `x` on which
   `f ≡ y₀` (using injectivity of `chartAt ℂ y₀` on its source). Hence
   `x ∈ S`. -/

/-- **Discharge of `ClopennessOfLocallyConstHypothesis`.** The
locally-constant locus `S = {x | ∀ᶠ x' in 𝓝 x, f x' = y₀}` of a `C^ω`
map `f : X → Y` is closed.

The proof is the chart-local identity theorem: at any closure point `x`
of `S`, continuity + `T2` already forces `f x = y₀`; analyticity of the
chart pullback on a preconnected open ball, combined with eventual
equality at a witness point of `S` inside the ball, propagates constancy
across the ball and hence to a neighbourhood of `x`. -/
