/-! # Fibres of a non-constant analytic map are finite

`clopennessOfLocallyConst_holds` closed
`ClopennessOfLocallyConstHypothesis` unconditionally;
`fibres_finite_statement_holds_of_clopennessOfLocallyConst` reduced
`fibres_finite_statement` to that hypothesis. Composing the two gives the
first `Degree` statement with no remaining hypotheses. -/
