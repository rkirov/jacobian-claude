/-! # Reducing `PerChartNonConstancyHypothesis` to non-constancy on chart balls

`WithinChartWitnessReduction.lean` reduced
`WithinChartWitnessHypothesis X Y` to `PerChartNonConstancyHypothesis X Y`.
That hypothesis asserts that, for every non-constant `C^ω` map `f : X → Y`
and every fibre point `x` of `y₀ = f x`, the chart pullback `F` differs from
`F ((chartAt ℂ x) x)` in *every* neighborhood of `(chartAt ℂ x) x`.

This file provides the **identity-theorem reduction** to a strictly
local, filter-free hypothesis: it suffices to exhibit, for *every* radius
`r > 0`, a single point `z₁ ∈ Metric.ball ((chartAt ℂ x) x) r` at which the
chart pullback differs from its value at the chart image of `x`.

The mechanism:

1. `contMDiff_omega_analyticAt_chart_pullback` supplies analyticity
   of the chart pullback at the chart image of `x`.
2. `exists_preconnected_open_ball_of_analyticAt` gives
   a preconnected open ball of analyticity of some radius `r₀ > 0`.
3. The all-radii hypothesis is applied at radius `r₀`, giving a witness
   `z₁` inside the *same* preconnected open ball where analyticity holds.
4. Mathlib's identity theorem
   (`AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq`) lifts that single
   off-centre value to non-constancy in *every* neighborhood of the centre:
   if `F` were eventually `F z₀` at `z₀`, identity would force
   `F = F z₀` on the whole preconnected ball, contradicting `F z₁ ≠ F z₀`.

The remaining obstruction is the existence of an off-centre value in
*every* small chart ball — a strictly local statement (no filters, no
preconnectedness, no analyticity of any kind in the input). Producing such
a witness from the global `¬ IsConstantMap f` remains the parameter-input. -/

/-! ## Identity-theorem core: not eventually `F z₀` from a single off-centre witness -/

/-- **Single-point off-centre witness ⇒ not eventually constant.** If `F` is
analytic on a preconnected open set `U`, `z₀ ∈ U`, and there is some
`z₁ ∈ U` with `F z₁ ≠ F z₀`, then `F` is not eventually `F z₀` at `z₀`. This
is the contrapositive of mathlib's identity theorem
(`AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq`) against the constant
`fun _ => F z₀`. -/

/-- **Per-point form of the identity-theorem reduction.** From analyticity on
a preconnected open `U` and a single off-centre witness `z₁ ∈ U` with
`F z₁ ≠ F z₀` (where `z₀ ∈ U`), every neighborhood of `z₀` contains a point
at which `F` differs from `F z₀`.

This is the per-point shape consumed by `PerChartNonConstancyHypothesis`. -/

/-! ## Hypothesis: chart-ball off-centre witness at every small radius -/

/-- **Chart-ball off-centre witness hypothesis (all radii).** For every
non-constant `C^ω` map `f : X → Y`, every fibre point `x` of every
`y₀ : Y`, and *every* radius `r > 0`, there is a point `z₁` in the open
ball of radius `r` around the chart image of `x` at which the chart
pullback `F` differs from `F` at the chart image of `x`.

Equivalently: the chart pullback is not locally constant at the chart
image of `x`.

This shape is strictly smaller than `PerChartNonConstancyHypothesis`:

* It eliminates the universal quantifier over neighborhoods `V ∈ 𝓝 z₀`.
  The caller produces, for each radius `r > 0`, a single off-centre witness
  inside `Metric.ball z₀ r` — the identity theorem (mathlib's
  `AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_of_preconnected_of_eventuallyEq`) lifts these
  witnesses to *every* neighborhood.
* It does not mention `Filter`, `𝓝`, or eventual equality at all.
* The metric structure is fixed (open balls in ℂ) — no preconnectedness,
  analyticity, or chart-data is required from the caller. -/

/-! ## Reduction: chart-ball off-centre witness ⇒ per-chart non-constancy -/

/-- **Reduction.** The chart-ball off-centre witness hypothesis (all radii)
implies the per-chart non-constancy hypothesis. The proof:

1. From `contMDiff_omega_analyticAt_chart_pullback` the chart
   pullback is `AnalyticAt ℂ` at the chart image of `x`.
2. By `exists_preconnected_open_ball_of_analyticAt`, there
   is a preconnected open ball of radius `r₀ > 0` on which the pullback is
   `AnalyticOnNhd ℂ`.
3. The hypothesis applied at radius `r₀` gives a witness `z₁` inside that
   same ball with `F z₁ ≠ F z₀`.
4. Mathlib's identity theorem (`exists_value_ne_in_nhds_of_witness` above)
   lifts this single off-centre witness to every neighborhood of `z₀`. -/
