/-! # Analytic derivative-order facts (planar, sphere-free)

A small ℂ-analytic fact used by the critical-set finiteness argument: a
non-locally-constant analytic function has a non-eventually-vanishing
derivative. Pure planar complex analysis — no Riemann-sphere / divisor
machinery. Relocated here so the map-level critical-set finiteness does not
depend on the meromorphic-function-to-sphere framing. -/

/-- **Non-locally-constant ⇒ derivative not eventually zero.** If `F : ℂ → ℂ`
is analytic at `z₀` and `F` is not eventually equal to `F z₀` on any
neighbourhood of `z₀`, then `deriv F` is not eventually zero on any
neighbourhood of `z₀`.

Reads off `AnalyticAt.analyticOrderAt_deriv_add_one`:
`analyticOrderAt (deriv F) z₀ + 1 = analyticOrderAt (F · - F z₀) z₀`. The
hypothesis forces the right-hand side ≠ ⊤ (else `F = F z₀` on a neighbourhood),
hence the left-hand side ≠ ⊤, i.e. `deriv F` is not eventually 0. -/
