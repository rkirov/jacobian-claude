# The coherent fibre selection bundling the Gate-A germ-coherence (Miranda §VIII.3)

`Jacobians.Dolbeault.FormTraceGlobalGeometric` reduced Gate A (`∑ₐ Resₐ(α) = 0` for `α = ω₀·g`) to the
**germ-coherence** hypotheses of the geometric trace `valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ` from a global fibre
selection `Φ : (b : ℂ) → FibreRegularData g f b`:

* `hglue_fin` — `valueChartTrace` germ-equals the pole sub-fibre trace `(fibreReg hac (cs i))` off each
  finite pole-value;
* `hglue_inf` — `recipCoeff (valueChartTrace)` germ-equals the `∞`-fibre trace off `0`;
* `hreg` — at each value off the centres, `valueChartTrace` germ-equals a fixed *regular* fibre trace;
* junk-freeness + the genus-`0` `∞`-vanishing.

This file packages those into one **`CoherentTraceSelection`** structure — the minimal honest §VIII.3
input — and proves it turns the key on Gate A `∑Res = 0` via the proved
`residueSum_eq_zero_of_geometricSelection_coh`.  The point of the packaging is twofold:

1. **It separates the genuinely-irreducible monodromy content from the discharged scaffolding.**  The
   `cs`/`ρ`/`Dinf`/enumeration bookkeeping comes from the `AdaptedCover`; what genuinely remains is the
   *self-coherence* of the geometric trace (the branched-cover sheet-gluing) — that near each base
   value the geometric trace, evaluated with the *varying* selection `Φ b'`, germ-equals the trace of a
   *single fixed* fibre.  That is Miranda's "the trace `Tr_F α` is a single (mero)morphic function"
   read in the fibre language.

2. **It honestly preserves the pole-sub-fibre nuance.**  `hglue_fin` glues to the pole sub-fibre
   `fibreReg hac (cs i)` (the sheets through the poles of `α`), NOT the full fibre — see the §VIII.3
   soundness note in `FormTraceGlobalGeometric`.  We carry the finite glue against the pole sub-fibre
   verbatim, so no false full-fibre germ-equality is asserted; the separation genericity is folded into
   the existence of the coherent selection (a Gate-D refinement).

We additionally prove the **section-identification reduction** that connects the proved per-sheet
covector linchpin (`FormTraceSheetFibreBridge.fibreTrace_sheet_eventuallyEq`) to the self-coherence
content (`traceCoeff_eventuallyEq_of_sheets_eventuallyEq`: if two fibre selections' planar sheets +
fibre points germ-match index-by-index near a base value, their trace coefficients germ-agree there),
and the **genus-`0` `∞`-vanishing as a sphere-form corollary** (`coeffAt_eq_zero_of_sphereForm`).

## What is proved (axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`)

* `traceCoeff_eventuallyEq_of_sheets_eventuallyEq` — trace coefficients germ-agree from per-sheet germ
  agreement (the reindexing core: two fibre selections sharing the same index type, fibre points, and
  planar section germs near `b` have germ-equal trace coefficients);
* `CoherentTraceSelection` — the structure bundling the minimal Gate-A germ-coherence obligation;
* `CoherentTraceSelection.residueSum_eq_zero` — Gate A `∑Res = 0` from a coherent selection;
* `residueSum_eq_zero_of_coherentSelection` — the same as a standalone theorem;
* `coherentTraceSelection_empty` / `residueSum_eq_zero_of_coherentSelection_holomorphic` — non-vacuity
  (the empty-pole case), confirming the structure is honest (not a disguised `False`).

/-! ### The per-sheet trace summand depends only on the fibre point and the section germ

The reusable core, at the abstract `FibreTrace` level: a single trace summand
`w ↦ coeff i (sheet i w)·deriv (sheet i) w` germ-depends on the section `sheet i` only through its
germ at the base (the `coeff i` is a *fixed* function, and `deriv` and composition are germ-local).  We
record the per-summand statement and the assembled finite-sum statement; both are pure germ-locality
(no geometry), and they are what the proved section identification feeds into. -/

/-- **A trace summand germ-depends only on the section germ.**  For a fixed coefficient function
`c : ℂ → ℂ` and two sections `s₁ s₂ : ℂ → ℂ` germ-equal near `b` (`hs : s₁ =ᶠ[𝓝 b] s₂`), the
pushforward summands germ-agree near `b`:

> `(fun w => c (s₁ w) · deriv s₁ w) =ᶠ[𝓝 b] (fun w => c (s₂ w) · deriv s₂ w)`.

*Proof.*  `s₁ =ᶠ[𝓝 b] s₂` gives both `c (s₁ w) = c (s₂ w)` (congruence under `c`) and
`deriv s₁ =ᶠ[𝓝 b] deriv s₂` (`Filter.EventuallyEq.deriv`, since `deriv` is germ-local), so the
products germ-agree. -/

/-! ### The trace coefficient via arbitrary right-inverse sections

Combining the proved section identification with the per-summand germ lemma: the local fibre trace
coefficient germ-equals the fibre sum read along **any** family of continuous right-inverses of the
chart pullbacks through the fibre points (not just the `exists_planar_section`-chosen sheets baked into
`fibreTrace`).  This is the reformulation a coherent-selection builder uses: the manifold local
sections (`exists_holo_localInverse` / `LocalSheetSystem`), read in charts, are such right-inverses, so
the geometric trace built from them has the *same germ* as the planar fibre trace. -/

/-- **The local fibre trace coefficient via arbitrary right-inverse sections.**  Let `D :
FibreRegularData g f b`, and let `rinv : D.ι → ℂ → ℂ` be a family of continuous right-inverses of the
chart pullbacks of `f.holoRepr` through the fibre points: for each `i`,
`rinv i b = chart_{xs i}(xs i)`, `rinv i` continuous at `b`, and `f.holoRepr (chart_{xs i}.symm (rinv i
w)) = w` near `b`.  Then the trace coefficient germ-equals the fibre sum read along `rinv`:

> `(fibreTrace ω₀ f D).traceCoeff =ᶠ[𝓝 b]
>     fun w => ∑ i, chartIntegrand ω₀ g (D.xs i) (rinv i w)·deriv (rinv i) w`.

*Proof.*  By the section identification (`fibreTrace_sheet_eventuallyEq`) each planar sheet
germ-equals the corresponding `rinv i`; by `traceSummand_eventuallyEq_of_section_eventuallyEq` each
per-sheet summand germ-agrees; a finite sum of germ-equalities is a germ-equality. -/

/-! ### The genus-`0` `∞`-vanishing as a sphere-form corollary

The genus-`0` `∞`-vanishing input `R₀ 0 = 0` is, conceptually, "the holomorphic remainder `Tr_F α −
L.R` is a holomorphic `1`-form on `ℂℙ¹`, hence `0` (`H⁰(ℂℙ¹, Ω) = 0`), hence its `∞`-coefficient is
`0`".  We record the reusable consequence: *any* holomorphic `1`-form on `RiemannSphere` has identically
zero chart coefficient `coeffAt` at every point (it is the zero section by
`ProjectiveLine.holomorphicOneForm_eq_zero`).  Once the remainder is packaged as such a sphere form,
its value-chart coefficient (and via the reciprocal-chart Jacobian, `R₀`) vanishes — discharging the
genus-`0` field of `CoherentTraceSelection`. -/

/-- **A holomorphic `1`-form on `ℂℙ¹` has zero chart coefficient everywhere.**  Every
`s : HolomorphicOneForms RiemannSphere` is the zero section (`holomorphicOneForm_eq_zero`,
`H⁰(ℂℙ¹, Ω) = 0`), so its coefficient read in any canonical chart vanishes:

> `coeffAt s a z = 0`   for all `a : RiemannSphere`, `z : ℂ`.

This is the genus-`0` engine for the `∞`-vanishing: the holomorphic remainder of the trace, once
realized as a sphere `1`-form, has vanishing coefficient in every chart (finite and reciprocal). -/

/-! ### The coherent fibre selection — the minimal Gate-A germ-coherence obligation

We package the inputs of `residueSum_eq_zero_of_geometricSelection_coh` (beyond the adapted-cover
scaffolding `cs`/`ρ`/`Dinf`/enumeration) into a single structure.  The genuinely-irreducible content
is the §VIII.3 monodromy: the geometric trace `valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ` (which at each base value `b'`
re-selects the fibre `Φ b'`) germ-equals a **single fixed** local fibre trace near each value — the
finite pole-values (against the pole sub-fibre `fibreReg hac`), `∞`, and every regular value.  Plus
junk-freeness and the genus-`0` `∞`-vanishing. -/

/-- **A coherent fibre selection** for `α = ω₀·g` over the pole set `poles`, relative to an adapted
cover `hac`.  Bundles the global fibre selection `Φ`, the finite-pole-value bookkeeping (`cs`/`ρ`/
`hcenters_cs`), the `∞`-fibre enumeration (`Dinf`/`hxs_*`), and the **germ-coherence** of the
geometric trace `valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ` with the local fibre traces:

* `hglue_fin` — germ-equality with the pole sub-fibre trace off each finite pole-value (the honest
  pole-sub-fibre glue — NOT a full-fibre germ-equality);
* `hglue_inf` — germ-equality of the reciprocal coefficient with the `∞`-fibre trace off `0`;
* `hreg` — at each value off the centres, germ-equality with a fixed *regular* fibre trace (with `g`'s
  chart-pullback analytic at each of its fibre points);
* `hcont_int` — junk-freeness (continuity of the remainder at each centre, for any internally-built
  `LaurentForm L`);
* `R₀` + `hR₀_*` — the genus-`0` `∞`-vanishing (the analytic continuation of the reciprocal remainder
  vanishes at `0`).

These are *exactly* the irreducible §VIII.3 inputs; the rest of Gate A is discharged.  A coherent
selection exists for a suitable adapted cover (the branched-cover sheet-gluing + the pole/regular
separation genericity); that existence is the remaining geometric obligation. -/

/-! ### Non-vacuity of the coherent selection (end-to-end soundness)

The `CoherentTraceSelection` obligation is *satisfiable*, not a disguised `False`: for the **empty pole
set** (`α = ω₀·g` globally holomorphic) the **empty fibre selection** `Φ p := emptyFibreRegularData g
f p` gives `valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ ≡ 0` (an empty fibre sum), with all the deep germ-coherence inputs
(finite/∞ glue, off-exceptional coherence, junk-freeness) vacuous over the empty centre set, the
`∞`-glue `recipCoeff 0 ≡ 0` matching the empty `∞`-trace, and the genus-`0` continuation `R₀ ≡ 0`
vanishing.  This confirms the structure produces a genuine `∑Res = 0`. -/

/-- **A coherent fibre selection for the empty pole set.**  The empty fibre selection (no fibre points
over any value, `valueChartTrace ≡ 0`) is a coherent selection for the globally-holomorphic case: no
finite centres (every glue/junk-free field vacuous), the empty `∞`-fibre (`recipCoeff 0 ≡ 0`), and the
vanishing genus-`0` continuation `R₀ ≡ 0`.  The honest non-vacuity witness. -/
