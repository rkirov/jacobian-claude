# The global trace function `Tr_F α` and its holomorphy off the exceptional set (Gate A, §VIII.3)

This file builds **steps 1–2** of the Miranda §VIII.3 trace-rationality programme (the deep core of
`Jacobians.Dolbeault.FormTraceGlobalConstruct.TraceRationalityWitness`):

1. **The local trace germ at a regular value.** Given a regular non-pole point `x₀` of the cover
   `F = f.toRiemannSphere` (chart-pullback of `f.holoRepr` analytic, nonzero derivative) over which
   `g`'s chart-pullback is analytic, the per-sheet pushforward of `α = ω₀·g` — read entirely in the
   value chart at `b = f.holoRepr x₀` via the planar section germ (`exists_planar_section`,
   `FormTraceFibre`) — is itself **analytic in the base coordinate**.  This is the per-sheet content
   of Miranda's trace `Tr_F α`.

2. **Holomorphy off the exceptional set.** The finite sum of these regular-sheet pushforwards over a
   regular fibre is analytic at the regular base value.  Off the (finite) exceptional set
   `criticalValues f ∪ poleValues ∪ {∞}`, the trace coefficient `Tr_F α` is therefore holomorphic.

This is the genuinely-analytic foundational layer the trace-rationality witness is assembled on; it
reuses the proven per-fibre Lemma 3.2 (`FormTraceFibre`) and the now-unconditional residue
change-of-variables (`MeromorphicTrace.residueChangeOfVariables`).  The remaining content (the global
trace as a single meromorphic function, its rationality on the compact `ℂℙ¹`, and Lemma 3.2 at `∞`)
sits on top of this; see the diagnosis at the bottom of the file and
`Jacobians.Dolbeault.FormTraceGlobalConstruct`.

## The design — read everything in the value chart at `b`

The single per-sheet pushforward of `α = ω₀·g` along a section `s : ℂ → ℂ` (the planar inverse of the
chart-pullback of `f`, `s b = pre`, `deriv s b ≠ 0`) is
`w ↦ (coeffAt ω₀ x₀ (s w) · g (chart_x₀⁻¹ (s w))) · deriv s w`,
the pushforward of the chart integrand `chartIntegrand ω₀ g x₀` (`FormTraceFibre`).  When the chart
integrand is **analytic** at `pre = s b` (i.e. `g`'s chart-pullback is analytic there — `x₀` a
non-pole of `α`), this is a composition of analytics times the analytic section derivative, hence
analytic at `b`.  Summing over the (finite) regular fibre gives the local trace coefficient, analytic
at `b`.  This is step 2: `Tr_F α` is holomorphic at every regular value off the poles of `α`.

/-! ### Step 1 — the regular-sheet pushforward is analytic in the base

The atom: pushing the chart integrand of `α = ω₀·g` forward along the planar section germ `s` of a
regular non-pole point is analytic at the base value `b`, provided `g`'s chart-pullback is *analytic*
(not merely meromorphic) at the source point — i.e. `α = ω₀·g` is holomorphic there, the defining
condition of a regular value off the poles. -/

/-- **The chart integrand of `α = ω₀·g` is analytic at the chart image of a non-pole point.**  When
`g`'s chart-pullback is analytic at `chart_a a` (so `α·g` has no pole at `a`), the chart integrand
`chartIntegrand ω₀ g a = coeffAt ω₀ a · (g ∘ chart_a⁻¹)` is analytic there (the product of the
analytic coefficient `coeffAt_analyticAt` with the analytic `g`-pullback). -/

/-! ### Step 2 — the local fibre trace coefficient is analytic at a regular value

Assembling step 1 over a regular fibre.  We package the per-fibre regularity data over a regular
value (the `FibreRegularData` of `FormTraceFibre`, *plus* analyticity of `g`'s pullback at each fibre
point — the "regular value off the poles of `α`" condition) and show the trace coefficient
`(fibreTrace ω₀ f D).traceCoeff` is analytic at `b`.

This is the local model of "`Tr_F α` is holomorphic at every regular value off the poles of `α`",
the analytic core of step 2 (holomorphy off the finite exceptional set). -/
