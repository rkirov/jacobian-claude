# The ramified geometric-trace identification `hcoh` (Forster §5 `z = wᵐ` normal form, slit branch)

This file builds the genuine geometric content of `RamifiedCenterFacts.hcoh`
(`Jacobians/Dolbeault/SerreResidueRamifiedCenter.lean`): at a (possibly ramified) finite pole-value
centre `c` of `α = ω₀·g`, the **geometric** value-chart trace germ `valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ` near `c`
*is* the **algebraic** `m`-sheet-sum trace of the per-preimage chart integrands.  It is the ramified
analogue of `exists_planar_section` (`FormTraceFibre.lean`, the unramified local biholomorphism that
identifies the geometric chart with the value chart), now for a ramification point of multiplicity
`m`, where the cover is the branched normal form `z = wᵐ` (Forster GTM 81, §5).

## ⚠ The monodromy obstruction — why the branch lives on a *slit*, not all of `𝓝[≠] c`

There is **no single-valued holomorphic `m`-th root of `z − c` on a punctured disk** when `m > 1`:
analytically continuing `(z − c)^{1/m}` once around `c` multiplies it by `ζ ≠ 1` (monodromy).  So the
two demands "`w₀` analytic on `𝓝[≠] c`" **and** "`w₀(z)ᵐ = z − c` on `𝓝[≠] c`" are *jointly
contradictory* for `m > 1`.  (An earlier version of `RamifiedSheetData` demanded exactly this — making
it a disguised `False` at every genuine ramification centre, satisfiable only at `m = 1`.  This file
fixes that.)

The resolution (the standard one): a holomorphic branch `w₀` of `(z − c)^{1/m}` **does** exist on a
*slit* `S` — a simply-connected open subset of the punctured neighbourhood, e.g. the punctured disk
minus a ray (concretely `{z | z − c ∈ slitPlane}`, on which `w₀ z = (z − c)^{1/m}` via `Complex.cpow`).
On the slit the geometry is exactly the unramified `m`-sheet picture, and the proven atom applies.  But
both the geometric trace `valueChartTrace` and the algebraic trace are **single-valued analytic on the
*full* punctured neighbourhood**: `valueChartTrace` because it is the *symmetric* sum over the `m`-point
fibre (a set — independent of the sheet labelling; Miranda (3.1) makes it meromorphic at `c`), and the
algebraic trace `ramifiedTraceTerm + Rem` by construction.  Two functions meromorphic at `c` that agree
on a slit accumulating at `c` agree on all of `𝓝[≠] c` by the **identity theorem**
(`MeromorphicAt.frequently_eq_iff_eventuallyEq`).  That is how `hcoh` is *derived* (never asserted).

## The geometry on the slit (Miranda §VIII.3, Forster §5)

On the slit, with the centered chart `w = chart_p` at `p`, the cover reads `z − c = (w − w_p)ᵐ` and the
fibre splits into the `m` sheets `w = w_p + ζʲ·w₀(z)` (`ζ` a primitive `m`-th root of unity).  The
value-chart trace over those sheets is the `m`-sheet sum

> `∑_{j<m} h(w_p + ζʲ w₀(z)) · (d/dz)[w_p + ζʲ w₀(z)]`,    `h := chartIntegrand ω₀ g p`,

with `(d/dz)[w_p + ζʲ w₀(z)] = ζʲ w₀'(z) = ζʲ·(1/m) w₀(z)^{1−m}` (from `m w₀^{m−1} w₀' = 1`).  By the
proven roots-of-unity collapse (`Jacobians.RamifiedTrace.laurentTraceCoeff_eq_sheetSum`) this `m`-sheet
sum, applied to the **Laurent principal part** of `h` at `w_p`, equals the closed-form
`laurentTraceCoeff (z − c)` — exactly the algebraic `ramifiedTraceTerm` whose residue is the upstairs
residue (`resAt_laurentTraceCoeff`).  The holomorphic remainder of `h` contributes a holomorphic trace
`Rem` (single-valued at `c` by the symmetric-function descent), which the residue does not see.

## What this file delivers

* **`RamifiedSheetData`** (the genuine geometric input): at one preimage `p`, the multiplicity `m`, a
  primitive `m`-th root `ζ`, a **slit** `S` accumulating at `c`, a holomorphic branch `w₀` of
  `(z − c)^{1/m}` **on `S`** (the Forster §5 analytic atom — the slit `m`-th root, which exists for any
  `m`), the per-preimage Laurent principal-part data + the **single-valued** analytic remainder trace
  `Rem`, the geometric identification `hgeom_slit` (on the slit), and — the genuine new content — the
  **single-valued meromorphy of the symmetric trace sum** `hvct_mero` at `c`.  All supplied as *data*,
  none asserted as a free lemma.

* **`eventuallyEq_of_meromorphic_eqOn_slit`** (the identity-theorem bridge, #3): two functions
  meromorphic at `c` agreeing on a slit accumulating at `c` agree on `𝓝[≠] c`
  (`MeromorphicAt.frequently_eq_iff_eventuallyEq`).

* **`RamifiedSheetData.traceFull` / `hcoh`** (the genuine new analytic content): the single-valued
  algebraic trace `T = ramifiedTraceTerm (principal part) + Rem`, equal on the slit to the geometric
  `m`-sheet sum (the atom, #1), hence equal to `valueChartTrace` on `𝓝[≠] c` by the identity theorem.

* **`RamifiedCenterFacts.ofSheetData`** (the sound capstone): assembles a `RamifiedCenterFacts` whose
  carried trace `T` is the single-valued `ramifiedTraceTerm + Rem`, with `hcoh` derived via the slit +
  identity theorem and `hmero`/`hres` via the proven atom.  Single-preimage form.

## ⚠ Soundness

* **No monodromy contradiction.**  `w₀` is required analytic only on the *slit* `S`; the structure is
  satisfiable for `m > 1` (`ramifiedSheetData_sqrt`, an explicit `m = 2` witness with the genuine slit
  branch `√(z − c)`), not just `m = 1`.
* `T = ramifiedTraceTerm + Rem` is single-valued meromorphic at `c`; `hcoh : valueChartTrace =ᶠ[𝓝[≠] c]
  T` is **derived** (identity theorem from agreement on the slit), never asserted.  `hmero`/`hres` come
  from the atom; `Rem` (analytic) contributes residue `0`.
* Every trace statement is the `m`-sheet **SUM** (the atom's roots-of-unity factor `∑(ζʲ)⁰ = m`
  cancels the chain-rule `1/m`); there is no single-sheet "`m·Res`" shortcut.

/-! ### The identity-theorem bridge (slit → punctured neighbourhood)

The mechanism by which a *slit* identity globalises: two functions meromorphic at `c` that agree on a
set accumulating at `c` agree on the whole punctured neighbourhood (Mathlib's meromorphic identity
theorem `MeromorphicAt.frequently_eq_iff_eventuallyEq`).  A slit (e.g. punctured-disk-minus-a-ray)
accumulates at `c`, so a branch-built equality on the slit upgrades to a `𝓝[≠] c` germ-equality. -/

/-- **Identity theorem on a slit.**  If `f` and `g` are meromorphic at `c` and agree on a set `S` that
accumulates at `c` (`∃ᶠ z in 𝓝[≠] c, z ∈ S` — true for a slit), then `f =ᶠ[𝓝[≠] c] g`.  This is the
engine that turns the slit-only branch identity into a punctured-neighbourhood germ-equality (so the
multivalued `m`-th root is needed only on the slit, dodging the monodromy obstruction). -/

/-! ### The Forster §5 slit sheet data (the genuine geometric input)

`RamifiedSheetData` packages, at one preimage `p` of multiplicity `m` over a centre `c`, the Forster
§5 local normal-form geometry as *data* (the ramified analogue of the `exists_planar_section` output),
**with the monodromy obstruction respected**: the `m`-th-root branch `w₀` lives on a *slit* `S`, not on
all of `𝓝[≠] c`.  The data also carries the single-valued algebraic trace ingredients (the Laurent
principal part of the chart integrand, and the single-valued analytic remainder trace `Rem`) plus the
genuine new content — the single-valued meromorphy of the symmetric trace sum `valueChartTrace` at `c`.
Everything downstream (`T`, `hcoh`, the residue/meromorphy) is *derived*. -/

/-- **Forster §5 slit sheet data at one preimage.**  At a preimage `p` of multiplicity `m ≥ 1` over the
centre `c`, with chart coordinate `wp := chart_p p`:

* `ζ` a primitive `m`-th root of unity;
* a **slit** `S ⊆ ℂ` accumulating at `c` (`hS_acc`), with a holomorphic branch `w₀` of `(z − c)^{1/m}`
  **on `S`** — nonvanishing (`hw₀_ne`), an `m`-th root (`hw₀_pow`), with the chain-rule derivative
  (`hw₀_deriv`).  This is the **Forster §5 analytic atom**, restricted to the slit where it exists for
  *any* `m` (no monodromy contradiction);
* per-preimage Laurent **principal-part data** of the chart integrand `h := chartIntegrand ω₀ g p`:
  degree `ppN`, coefficients `ppb`, analytic remainder `ppR` (`hppR_an`), with the split holding at the
  sheet points along the slit (`hpp_split_sheet`).  `hppN_res` records that the principal part carries
  the upstairs residue (a true fact about the Laurent expansion at `p`, *not* the downstairs residue);
* the **single-valued analytic remainder trace** `Rem` (`hRem_an : AnalyticAt ℂ Rem c`), the
  symmetric-function descent of the `m`-sheet sum of `ppR` (`hRem_slit`, on the slit) — the standard
  "trace of a holomorphic form is holomorphic", now stated as a single-valued function at `c`;
* the **geometric identification** `hgeom_slit`: on the slit, `valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ` equals the
  `m`-sheet sum `∑_{j<m} h(wp + ζʲ w₀(z))·(d/dz)[wp + ζʲ w₀(z)]`;
* `hvct_mero` — the genuine new content (Miranda (3.1)): the symmetric trace sum `valueChartTrace ω₀ f Φ`
  (single-valued by construction — a *set* sum over the fibre) is **meromorphic at `c`**.

Supplied as *data* (as the unramified `MovingCoherenceDatum` is), never asserted as a free lemma; the
single-valued trace `T`, the punctured germ-equality `hcoh`, the residue and meromorphy are all
*derived* (`RamifiedCenterFacts.ofSheetData`). -/

The reusable algebraic core: when the chart integrand near `wp` is the Laurent polynomial
`W ↦ ∑_i cf_i (W − wp)^{n_i}`, its `m`-sheet sum along `w = wp + ζʲ w₀(z)` is exactly the closed-form
`laurentTraceCoeff (z − c) = ramifiedTraceTerm`, by the proven roots-of-unity collapse
`laurentTraceCoeff_eq_sheetSum`.  The branch `w₀` (`w₀ ≠ 0`, `w₀ᵐ = z − c`, `w₀' = (1/m) w₀^{1−m}`)
turns the geometric sheet sum into the atom's LHS verbatim. -/

(`w₀ z ≠ 0`, `w₀(z)ᵐ = z − c`, `w₀'(z) = (1/m) w₀(z)^{1−m}`, `ζ` a primitive `m`-th root), the
`m`-sheet sum `∑_{j<m} hpoly(wp + ζʲ w₀(z))·(d/dz)[wp + ζʲ w₀(z)]` equals
`ramifiedTraceTerm s cf n m c z`.  Pure algebra: substitute `W − wp = ζʲ w₀(z)` and the chain-rule

/-! ### The single-valued algebraic trace `T` and the slit identity

From the slit sheet data `S`, the **single-valued** algebraic trace is

> `T := ramifiedTraceTerm (Icc 1 ppN) ppb (k ↦ −k) m c  +  Rem`

(`ramifiedTraceTerm` the `m`-sheet-sum trace of the integrand's Laurent **principal part**, `Rem` the
single-valued analytic remainder trace).  `T` is single-valued and meromorphic at `c` *by
construction*.  On the slit `S`, `T` equals the geometric `m`-sheet sum `valueChartTrace` (the proven
atom `ramifiedSheetSum_laurentPoly` + the data fields).  Since both `T` and `valueChartTrace` are
meromorphic at `c` and the slit accumulates at `c`, the identity theorem upgrades the slit identity to
the punctured germ-equality `hcoh` — without ever needing the multivalued branch off the slit. -/

Assembling the full `RamifiedCenterFacts` at a single ramified preimage centre.  The carried trace
`T := traceFull` is the single-valued `ramifiedTraceTerm (principal part) + Rem` (NOT the multivalued
sheet sum), so `hcoh : valueChartTrace =ᶠ[𝓝[≠] c] T` is the genuine punctured germ-equality, *derived*
via the slit identity + the identity theorem; `hmero`/`hres` come from the proven atom. -/

/-! ### Soundness sanity — the carried trace is single-valued; the slit identity recovers the geometry

The carried trace `T = traceFull` is, by construction, the **single-valued** function
`ramifiedTraceTerm (principal part) + Rem` (a meromorphic function of `z − c`), *not* the multivalued
sheet sum.  It coincides with the geometric `m`-sheet sum exactly on the slit `S`
(`eqOn_traceFull_slit`), and that slit agreement is what the identity theorem promotes to `hcoh`.  At an
*unramified* preimage (`m = 1`) the slit can be taken to be the full punctured neighbourhood and the
construction degenerates to the unramified single-section identification (witnessed at `m = 1` by
`ramifiedSheetData_zero`).  We record the single-valued definitional shape as a sanity check. -/

/-! ### Non-vacuity of `RamifiedSheetData` — inhabitable for **any** `m` (the monodromy fix verified)

`RamifiedSheetData`'s fields are *jointly satisfiable for every `m ≥ 1`*, so `RamifiedCenterFacts.
ofSheetData` is **not** vacuous, and — crucially — the structure is **not a disguised `False` at a
ramified centre** (the bug it replaces).  Witness: the zero numerator `g ≡ 0` (so `α = ω₀·g = 0`), the
empty fibre selection (`valueChartTrace ≡ 0`), with the genuine **slit `m`-th-root branch**
`w₀ z = (z − c)^{1/m}` (`Complex.cpow`) on the slit `S = {z | z − c ∈ slitPlane}` — which exists for
*any* `m` (the whole point of the slit).  At `m = 2` this is the genuine `√(z − c)` branch on the
slit-plane, demonstrating the structure is inhabited at a *ramified* multiplicity.  Every other field is
`0 = 0` by direct computation (`g ≡ 0`), and the branch fields are the standard `cpow` identities. -/

/-- **`RamifiedSheetData` is inhabitable for every `m ≥ 1`** (non-vacuity / soundness witness — the
monodromy fix).  For the zero numerator `g ≡ 0`, the empty fibre selection, any centre `c`, point `p`,
multiplicity `m ≥ 1`, and primitive `m`-th root `ζ`, the slit `S = {z | z − c ∈ slitPlane}` with the
`cpow` branch `w₀ z = (z − c)^{1/m}` is a valid `RamifiedSheetData`.  The branch exists on the slit for
**any** `m` (no monodromy contradiction), so the structure is inhabited at genuinely ramified
multiplicities — e.g. `m = 2`, the `√(z − c)` branch (`ramifiedSheetData_sqrt`). -/
