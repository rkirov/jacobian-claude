  Dolbeault ladder — the sup-norm Čech model TYPES and abstract finiteness spine (Forster 14.9).

  This is the *type / abstract-spine* base of the manifold instantiation of the Čech finiteness node.
  It was split out of `CechFinitenessWiring.lean` to BREAK an import cycle: the model types
  (`DiskOverlapData`, `Coboundaries`, `supH1`) are consumed by `CechModelArtificial` /
  `CechModelGeometry`, which in turn feed (transitively) the general-divisor finiteness term
  `CechFinitenessDtwist.exists_cechModel_general`; that term is what discharges
  `CechFinitenessWiring.exists_cechModel`.  Keeping the types here (importing only the abstract spine)
  lets `CechFinitenessWiring` import `CechFinitenessDtwist` without a cycle.

  This file ASSEMBLES the proven abstract finiteness spine
  (`CechFinitenessAbstract.finiteDimensional_h1_of_leray_compact`, `isCompactOperator_pi`,
  `isCompactOperator_of_subtypeL_comp`) against the proven disk-Montel atom
  (`BddHol.isCompactOperator_restrictCLM`) to provide the finiteness machinery used to discharge
  `DolbeaultLadder.finiteDimensional_cechH1`.

  CHOSEN SUP-NORM COCHAIN ENCODING (the Leray chart-disk cover, read in charts):
  the 1-cochains on the COVER live in `Π_p BddHol (Uov p)` (bounded-holomorphic on the chart-image
  of each overlap, an open set in `ℂ`); the 1-cochains on the relatively-compact SHRINKING live in
  `Π_p (Kov p →ᵇ ℂ)` (the Montel atom restricts `BddHol U →L[ℂ] (K →ᵇ ℂ)` for `K` compact, so the
  shrinking side is a product of `→ᵇ` spaces, NOT `BddHol`). Cocycle subspaces are kernels of the
  sup-norm coboundary `δ¹`, hence closed (so Banach). This data is packaged in `DiskOverlapData`
  (the geometric overlap data) + `Coboundaries` (the sup-norm `δ⁰/δ¹` and the commuting square for
  restriction).

  WHAT IS PROVEN HERE (axiom-clean, `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`):
    * `DiskOverlapData` Banach instances; `rhoRaw` + `rhoRaw_compact` (STEP 3 — the Montel payoff).
    * `finiteDimensional_supH1` — STEP 5: builds the cocycle `δ`/`ρ`, transports compactness to the
      closed cocycle subspace, and applies the abstract reduction. Fully proven *given* the Leray
      surjectivity (an explicit argument).
    * `leray_surjective` — STEP 4: the Leray surjectivity, derived from the model's `leray` field.
    * `exists_cechModel_of_subsingleton` — the assembled acyclic case (`H¹ = 0`).

  KEY DESIGN POINT (soundness): the Leray surjectivity `(η,ξ) ↦ δη + ρξ` is FALSE for an arbitrary
  abstract `(δ, ρ)` — a *compact* `ρ` (which `rhoRaw_compact` proves ours is) cannot surject onto an
  infinite-dimensional cocycle space. Surjectivity holds only for a genuine *acyclic* Leray model.
  We therefore record the acyclicity as the `Coboundaries.leray` field (the disk-`H¹=0` witness):
  `leray_surjective` then unpacks it, and the honest analytic obligation is concentrated
  where the model is CONSTRUCTED — discharged in `CechFinitenessDtwist.exists_cechModel_general`.

/-- **Sup-norm cochain geometry.** The finite pair-index `J` of a Leray chart-disk cover, with, for
each overlap `p`, the chart-image cover-open `Uov p ⊆ ℂ` and a relatively-compact convex shrinking
`Kov p ⋐ Uov p`. This is exactly the geometric input the disk-Montel atom needs (open `U`, compact
convex `K ⊆ U`). The cover 1-cochains live in `Π_p BddHol (Uov p)`, the shrinking 1-cochains in
`Π_p (Kov p →ᵇ ℂ)`. -/

`δ¹∘δ⁰ = 0`, a coboundary `δ¹` on the COVER side (whose kernel is `Z¹(cover)`), and the commuting
square saying restriction `ρ` carries cover-cocycles to shrinking-cocycles. These are the analytic
inputs that make `Z¹/B¹` the sup-norm `H¹`. -/

  (`δ¹_cov x = 0`). This is the genuine analytic content of the Leray model — it is precisely
  `H¹(disk, 𝒪) = 0` on each chart-disk (the disk-acyclicity supplied by the proven full-disk
  ∂̄-solvability `DbarDiskCohomology.dbar_solvable_ball` / `dbar_holo_splitting_ball`) together with
  the Čech-refinement comparison. Without this field the abstract data is NOT a Leray model and
  surjectivity is FALSE (a compact `ρ` cannot surject an infinite-dimensional `Z¹`); bundling it here
  is what makes `Coboundaries d` mean "an acyclic chart-disk Leray model". The honest analytic
