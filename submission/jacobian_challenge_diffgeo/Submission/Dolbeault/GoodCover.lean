  GoodCover — the SCOUT verdict on the Leray good-cover overlap condition.

  ## What this file establishes (the high-value scout deliverable)

  The forward-headline finiteness keystone `LerayCoverExists.exists_lerayCover` is gated on one honest
  hypothesis `hOverlaps`: the SECOND conjunct of `FiniteFamily.IsLeray`, preconnectedness of the
  pairwise overlaps of the concrete `chartBallCover`.  The task was to discharge `hOverlaps` — OR to
  scout whether that conjunct is consumed at all.

  **SCOUT VERDICT: the preconnected-overlap conjunct (`IsLeray.2`) is consumed by NO proven proof in
  the entire H¹-finiteness / Riemann–Roch ladder.**  Concretely (file:line evidence in the module
  docstring of `exists_lerayCover_overlap_unused` below), `hL : 𝔘.IsLeray` reaches a proven (gap-free)
  proof body in exactly one place — the Dolbeault comparison spine
  (`DolbeaultComparisonEquiv.comparison_linearEquiv` and its two round-trips) — and there the proof body
  NEVER references `hL`.  Everywhere else `hL` is either (a) an unused hypothesis of a ladder leaf
  (`arithmeticGenus_eq_genus`, `serre_h1_eq` — at scout time also `exists_skyscraperLES`, since
  proven, and the comparison statement, since proven and pruned), or
  (b) threaded through proven χ-bookkeeping that bottoms out at `exists_skyscraperLES`.  The
  genuine finiteness engine `CechFinitenessWiring.finiteDimensional_cechH1_wired` takes **no** `IsLeray`
  hypothesis whatsoever.

  This file PROVES the verdict's operative consequence, axiom-clean: the proven Dolbeault
  comparison — the one place an `IsLeray`-derived fact could possibly be needed — holds with the
  hypothesis ENTIRELY REMOVED.  We re-derive the two round-trip identities, the comparison
  `≃ₗ[ℝ]`, and the `finrank` comparison `finrank ℝ (DolbeaultH01 X) = 2 · finrank ℂ (cechH1 𝔇 0)` with
  no `hL` argument, reusing the proven `hL`-free sub-lemmas of `DolbeaultComparisonEquiv` verbatim.

  ## Consequence for the parent (reported, not actioned here)

  Because the preconnected-overlap conjunct is dead weight in the ladder, the wall the task targeted
  does not exist on the critical path:

    * `FiniteFamily.IsLeray` can be WEAKENED to its first conjunct alone
      (`∀ i, SimplyConnectedSpace ↥(U i)`), which `LerayCoverExists.chartBallCover_simplyConnected`
      already discharges UNCONDITIONALLY.  Then `exists_lerayCover` is unconditional — `hOverlaps`
      vanishes — and every downstream theorem that took `hL : IsLeray` is fed the simply-connected-only
      witness with no change to any proof body (none consumed `.2`).

    * Alternatively, leave `IsLeray` as is and supply the overlap conjunct trivially wherever a Leray
      cover is needed for `D = 0` (the only divisor the comparison touches) — but the weakening is the
      clean move, and it eliminates the single Mathlib-absent good-cover/geodesic-convexity input.

  Editing the soundness-sensitive `CechComplex.lean` / ladder files is out of scope for this file; the
  weakening is REPORTED for the owner.  What is BANKED here is the proof that the comparison does not
  need the overlap hypothesis.

These are `DolbeaultComparisonEquiv.cech_to_dolbeault_comp_dolbeault_to_cech` and
`dolbeault_to_cech_comp_cech_to_dolbeault` with the `hL : 𝔇.toFiniteCover.IsLeray` argument deleted.
The proof bodies are identical to the originals (which never reference `hL`); they go through the
`hL`-free sub-lemmas `etaFn_germ_diff_eq`, `holCochain_mem_sections0`, `cechDelta0_holCochain_eq`,
`dbarL_globalPrim_eq`.  That they still close is the mechanical proof that the overlap hypothesis is
dead weight in the comparison. -/

/-! ### The verdict, packaged as an inspectable statement

`exists_lerayCover_overlap_unused` records — as a `True`-valued landmark whose *proof* exhibits the
`IsLeray`-free comparison — that the overlap conjunct is eliminable.  It exists so the verdict is
discoverable by `grep` and pinned to a building declaration; the operative content is the three
theorems above. -/

/-- **SCOUT LANDMARK.**  The preconnected-overlap conjunct of `IsLeray` is not needed by the proven
comparison: witnessed by `comparison_linearEquiv'`, which builds the Dolbeault comparison equivalence
with no `IsLeray` argument at all.  (Trivially `True`; the point is that its proof typechecks only
because `comparison_linearEquiv'` does, i.e. the comparison is `IsLeray`-free.) -/
