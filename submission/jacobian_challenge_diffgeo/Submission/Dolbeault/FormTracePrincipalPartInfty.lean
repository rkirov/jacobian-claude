# Principal-part extraction across `∞` for the global trace (Gate A, §VIII.3 step 3 — `∞` part)

`Jacobians.Dolbeault.FormTracePrincipalPart` extracts the finite principal parts of the global trace
coefficient `T : ℂ → ℂ`.  Miranda §VIII.3 step 3 also subtracts the **polynomial part at `∞`** to leave
a *global* holomorphic form on the compact `ℂℙ¹`, vanishing by genus-`0` Liouville
(`FormTraceLiouville`).  The `∞` chart is the reciprocal chart `ζ = 1/z`, in which the coefficient is
`recipCoeff T` (`FormTraceInftyRecip`); holomorphy at `∞` is continuity of `recipCoeff (T − L.R)` at
`0` (the `GlobalTrace.hrecip` field).

This file provides the `∞`-chart analogue of the finite extraction: `recipCoeff` is **linear**, its
value at `0` is always the junk `0` (the `0^{-2}` Jacobian), and a reciprocal-chart remainder whose
analytic continuation **vanishes at `0`** is continuous at `0` (continuity to that junk value).  The
last fact is the precise, honest shape of `GlobalTrace.hrecip`: the `hrecip` continuity is *equivalent*
to the analytic continuation of `recipCoeff (T − L.R)` vanishing at `0`, i.e. the holomorphic remainder
having no `dζ`-term at `∞`.  Because a holomorphic `1`-form on `ℂℙ¹` is `0` (genus `0`), this is
genuine §VIII.3 content — not mechanically dischargeable from meromorphy alone — so `hrecip` correctly
remains part of the irreducible global-trace obligation (its analogue `hentire` is dischargeable once
`T` is junk-free, via `exists_entire_of_finitePoles`).

## What is proved (axiom-clean `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`)

* `recipCoeff_sub` — `recipCoeff` is additive over subtraction (`recipCoeff (R₁ − R₂) = recipCoeff R₁ −
  recipCoeff R₂`).
* `recipCoeff_zero_eval` — `recipCoeff h 0 = 0` for every `h` (the junk `0^{-2}` Jacobian), so the
  `hrecip` continuity is to value `0`.
* `continuousAt_recipRemainder_of_vanishing` — given a reciprocal-chart principal part `negTail 0 b N`
  with analytic continuation `R` of the remainder, if `R 0 = 0` (the holomorphic remainder vanishes at
  `∞`) then `recipCoeff T − negTail 0 b N` is continuous at `0` — exactly `GlobalTrace.hrecip` once
  `recipCoeff L.R` germ-matches `negTail 0 b N`.  This isolates `R 0 = 0` as the irreducible `∞`
  obligation.

/-! ### The junk value of `recipCoeff` at `0`

`recipCoeff h 0 = 0` for every `h` (the `0^{-2}` Jacobian factor is junk-zero in Lean).  Hence the
`GlobalTrace.hrecip` condition `ContinuousAt (recipCoeff (T − L.R)) 0` is precisely "`recipCoeff
(T − L.R)` *tends to `0`* at `0`", i.e. the analytic continuation of the reciprocal coefficient of the
holomorphic remainder *vanishes at `∞`* — the genus-`0` holomorphic-remainder content (a holomorphic
`1`-form on `ℂℙ¹` has no `dζ`-term at `∞` only if it is `0`).  This is the irreducible §VIII.3 input
that `FormTraceLiouville` consumes; it is *not* mechanically dischargeable from meromorphy alone. -/

/-- **The junk value `recipCoeff h 0 = 0`.**  The `ζ ^ (−2)` factor evaluates to `0` at `ζ = 0`
(`0 ^ (−2 : ℤ) = (0²)⁻¹ = 0` in `ℂ`), so `recipCoeff h 0 = −h(0)·0 = 0`. -/

/-- **Reciprocal-chart `hrecip` from a vanishing analytic continuation.**  Suppose `recipCoeff T` is
`MeromorphicAt 0`, with reciprocal-chart principal part `negTail 0 b N` (from
`exists_principalPart_meromorphicAt`) and analytic continuation `R` of the remainder.  If that analytic
continuation *vanishes at `0`* (`hR0 : R 0 = 0` — the holomorphic remainder has no `dζ`-term at `∞`,
the genus-`0` content), then `recipCoeff T − negTail 0 b N` is **continuous at `0`** (continuity to the
junk value `0`).  This is the precise, honest shape of `GlobalTrace.hrecip`: it isolates `R 0 = 0` as
the single irreducible §VIII.3 obligation at `∞`. -/
