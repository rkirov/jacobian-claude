  The **closed-core** partition-of-unity primitives for the disk-acyclicity.

  A `SharedChartCover` is a finite *family* of opens living in one chart (not a cover of compact
  `X` — a single chart cannot cover a compact connected surface).  The disk-acyclicity globalizes
  a cocycle with a smooth partition of unity `ρ` subordinate to the family `(Uᵢ)`.  A subordinate
  PoU *cannot* sum to `1` on the open `⋃ Uᵢ`: that would force `⋃ Uᵢ` clopen, hence `= X` on
  connected `X`.

  Instead, sum to `1` only on a **closed core** `C ⊆ ⋃ Uᵢ`.  Mathlib's
  `SmoothPartitionOfUnity.exists_isSubordinate` takes a *closed* `s ⊆ ⋃ Uᵢ`; with `s := C` it
  gives a subordinate PoU summing to `1` on `C` — no clopen issue.  Since every pairwise overlap
  of a `SharedChartCover` lies in `interior C`, the cocycle germ-splitting (consumed only at
  overlap points) happens exactly where `∑ ρ = 1` on a neighbourhood.

  The lemmas are stated abstractly over a finite family `U : ι → Opens X` and a closed
  `C ⊆ ⋃ Uᵢ`, so they are independent of the `SharedChartCover` packaging and reusable for any
  closed-core globalization.

/-! ## The closed-core subordinate partition of unity

A compact `T2` `ℂ`-manifold is a `σ`-compact finite-dimensional real manifold (over `𝓘(ℝ, ℂ)`), so
Mathlib's manifold PoU applies. We expose the closed-core existence and the sum-on-`C` value form.

/-- **Closed-core subordinate PoU exists.**  For a finite family of opens `U : ι → Opens X` and a
CLOSED set `C ⊆ ⋃ i, Uᵢ`, there is a smooth partition of unity over `𝓘(ℝ, ℂ)`, subordinate to `(Uᵢ)`
(`tsupport ρᵢ ⊆ Uᵢ`), summing to `1` on `C`. This is the sound replacement for the (vacuous on a
single-chart family) `univ`-subordinate PoU: the closed set `C` is the sum-to-one locus, avoiding
the clopen obstruction. Direct application of `SmoothPartitionOfUnity.exists_isSubordinate` with
`s := C`. -/
