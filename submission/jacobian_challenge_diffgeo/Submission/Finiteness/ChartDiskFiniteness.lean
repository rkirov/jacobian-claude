  Čech `H¹` finiteness on a CHART-DISK cover — Forster GTM 81 §14, the analytic heart.

  Goal: `FiniteDimensional ℂ (𝔇.toFiniteCover.cechH1 0)` for a `ChartDiskCover 𝔇` (and, via the
  `GoodCover.comparison_linearEquiv'`, `FiniteDimensional ℝ (DolbeaultH01 X)`).

  ## Why a `ChartDiskCover` (the strategic framing)

  The repo's generic finiteness engine `CechFiniteness.finiteDimensional_h1_of_leray_compact`
  (Forster 14.8 / Schwartz–Riesz) needs a SURJECTIVITY ("leray") field: every shrinking-cocycle is
  `δ⁰(holomorphic 0-cochain) + ρ(cover-cocycle)`. For the Montel `chartCover` this field was a
  genuine obstruction (that route is abandoned): the Montel cover sets `Uov` are chart-images of
  `chartOpen ∩ chartOpen`, i.e. ARBITRARY planar opens, not balls; the per-chart cutoff ∂̄-solve
  then produces the cover cocycle only on the shrinking `Wov`, not the full overlap `Uov` (the
  two-scale cutoff dilemma), and the no-cutoff route would need ∂̄-solvability on an arbitrary
  planar open (Behnke–Stein, absent from Mathlib).

  A `ChartDiskCover` removes the obstruction: `U i` is the chart-preimage of a Euclidean *ball*
  (`ChartDiskCover.isDisk`). Forster 14.6 then takes the cocycle at the COVER level and solves
  `∂̄h_i = ω_i` on the FULL ball `U_i` (no cutoff — `DbarDiskCohomology.dbar_solvable_ball` applies
  to the whole ball), so the cover cocycle `ζ_{ij} = h_j∘τ_{ij} − h_i` is holomorphic on the FULL
  overlap automatically: the (0,1)-frame factors `conj(τ′)` cancel by the Wirtinger chain rule
  `dbarDisk_comp_holo` (`∂̄(h_j∘τ) = conj(τ′)·(∂̄h_j)∘τ = conj(τ′)·ω_j∘τ = ω_i = ∂̄h_i`). No cutoff
  dilemma. This is the genuinely-unblocked Forster 14.6 + 14.7 route.

  ## What this file delivers

  * The chart-disk geometry of a `ChartDiskCover` (ball images, overlap images, half-radius
    shrinkings, transitions, relative compactness).
  * The instantiation of the generic `HolomorphicDiskOverlapData` (`CechModelHolomorphic.lean`) from
    a `ChartDiskCover`, with the compact restriction `ρ` (Montel).
  * The Forster 14.6 ball-lift, the ANALYTIC HEART (the genuinely-unblocked content).
  * The FA finiteness assembly via `finiteDimensional_h1_of_leray_compact`.

  The δ-complex + germ↔`BddHol` comparison that feed the assembly are BUILT downstream in
  `ChartDiskFinitenessComplete.lean` (`finiteDimensional_cechH1_chartDisk_complete`, complete and
  axiom-clean).

For a `ChartDiskCover 𝔇` with index `i`, chart `φ_i = chartAt (center i)`, center coordinate
`e_i = extChartAt 𝓘(ℝ,ℂ) (center i) (center i)` and radius `radius i`, the chart image of `U_i` is
the ball `ball (e_i) (radius i)`. Note `chartAt (H := ℂ) x = extChartAt 𝓘(ℝ,ℂ) x` (the identity
model), a defeq we use to read `ChartDiskCover.isDisk`/`closedBall_subset_target` against `chartAt`.

The cover chart transition `τ_{ij} = φ_j ∘ φ_i.symm` (chart-`i` → chart-`j` coordinates). On a ball
cover the key analytic fact is the Forster 14.6 (0,1)-frame identity: the per-ball ∂̄-data
`ω_i := ∂̄g_i` of a smooth split transform across charts by `conj(τ′)`, the defining feature of a
global (0,1)-form (the obstruction to gluing into one scalar `ℂ→ℂ` function). This is the genuine
analytic content of the lift, and it is what makes the per-ball solve assemble to a holomorphic
cover cocycle. -/

/-! ## §3 — The Forster 14.6 cover-level ∂̄-lift on a ball (THE ANALYTIC HEART)

This is the genuinely-unblocked content the Montel model cannot reach.  The inputs are the standard
Bott–Tu smooth split of a holomorphic cover cocycle: chart-read smooth functions `g_a : ℂ → ℂ` (the
PoU split, `g_a = ∑_c ρ̂_c · s_{ca}∘φ_a⁻¹`), smooth on the ball `ball (e a) (radius a)`, whose
overlap differences are holomorphic (`g_b∘τ_{ab} − g_a = s_{ab}∘φ_a⁻¹`, holomorphic on the overlap).
We isolate this data as a hypothesis bundle `BallSplitData` and prove the analytic core:

  * the (0,1)-frame identity `∂̄g_a = conj(τ_{ab}′)·(∂̄g_b)∘τ_{ab}` on overlaps (Wirtinger chain
    rule);
  * the per-ball solve `∂̄h_a = ∂̄g_a` on the FULL ball (Forster 13.2, `dbar_solvable_open_disk` —
    no cutoff, because the cover set IS a ball);
  * the holomorphic correctors `η_a := g_a − h_a` holomorphic on the ball, and the holomorphic cover
    cocycle `x_{ab} := h_b∘τ_{ab} − h_a` (holomorphic on the overlap), with the split identity
    `s_{ab} = (η_b∘τ − η_a) + x_{ab}` on the overlap.

Isolating the PoU split as a hypothesis separates the pure complex analysis (this section, the
genuine contribution that the ball geometry unblocks) from the standard PoU-telescoping bookkeeping
(which is the kind of cover-specific plumbing already done in `GluedDbarDatum`/`DiskAcyclicSolve`).
-/

/-- **Bott–Tu smooth-split data for a holomorphic cover cocycle on the ball cover (chart-read).**

`s a b` is the chart-`a`-read of the cocycle component over `U_a ∩ U_b` (a function `ℂ → ℂ`,
holomorphic on the overlap image `Uov (a,b)`). `g a` is the chart-`a`-read smooth split (`ℂ → ℂ`,
smooth on the whole ball `ball (e a) (radius a)`). The split identity says `g` telescopes the
cocycle on overlaps: `g_b(τ_{ab} z) − g_a(z) = s_{ab}(z)` for `z` in the overlap image. This is
exactly the output of a PoU smooth split (Bott–Tu); we take it as a hypothesis so the section is the
pure analysis. -/

/-! ### The per-ball ∂̄-solve and the holomorphic correctors

Solve `∂̄h_a = ∂̄g_a` on the FULL ball `ball (e a) (radius a)` (Forster 13.2 — no cutoff, the cover
set IS a ball). `∂̄g_a` is smooth on the ball (∂̄ of the smooth `g_a`), so `dbar_solvable_open_disk`
applies. Then `η_a := g_a − h_a` is holomorphic on the ball, and the cover cochain
`x_{ab} := h_b∘τ − h_a` is holomorphic on the FULL overlap (the frame identity makes
`∂̄(h_b∘τ) = ∂̄h_a` there). -/

/-! ## §3b — The covering relatively-compact shrinking (Forster §12) and the
`HolomorphicDiskOverlapData`

The shrinking lemma `exists_iUnion_eq_closure_subset` (normal space — `X` compact T2) gives a
COVERING open shrinking `V_i ⋐ U_i` of the cover sets, with `closure V_i ⊆ U_i`. Its chart-image
overlaps `Wov (i,j) := φ_i '' (V_i ∩ V_j)` are relatively compact inside `Uov (i,j)` (the chart
restricts to a homeomorphism on the compact `closure (V_i ∩ V_j) ⊆ U_i ⊆ φ_i.source`). This builds
the `HolomorphicDiskOverlapData` for the chart-disk cover — whose `ρ` is compact for free (Montel) —
closing the relatively-compact-shrinking part of the structural plumbing. -/

/-! ## §4 — Connecting the analytic heart to `FiniteDimensional ℂ (cechH1 𝔇 0)`

The FA finiteness engine `CechFiniteness.finiteDimensional_h1_of_leray_compact` (Forster 14.8/14.7,
Schwartz–Riesz) needs a `HolomorphicCoboundaries` model `c` for a `HolomorphicDiskOverlapData` with:
  * `ρ` compact (Montel) — for any `HolomorphicDiskOverlapData` (`ρ_compact`), the only input
    being a relatively-compact open shrinking `Wov ⋐ Uov`;
  * the `leray` surjectivity — the analytic heart, whose function-level content is proven
    (`ChartDiskCover.forster146_lift`).

The remaining structural plumbing to reach the literal germ-class `cechH1 𝔇 0` (NOT analytic
content):
  * **(G-shrink)** a concrete relatively-compact open shrinking `Wov (i,j) ⋐ Uov (i,j)` of the ball
    overlaps whose inner balls STILL cover `X` (so a subordinate PoU summing to `1` on `X` exists —
    the Bott–Tu split that produces `BallSplitData`). A generic `ChartDiskCover` does not carry this
    covering-shrinking; it is the geometric refinement Forster builds (a "relatively-compact
    shrinking of a cover is a cover", Forster §12).
  * **(G-bridge)** the germ↔`BddHol` identification of the chart-read holomorphic functions with the
    model's `Cshr`/`Ccov` cochains, descending to and inverting the forward
    `CechModelCochain.cochainToCcov` (the round-trip `cechH1 ≃ supH1`).

These two are pure cover/sheaf plumbing (no ∂̄, no Montel) — the analytic content is already
discharged. We package the reduction so the connection is explicit and the heart is plugged in. -/
