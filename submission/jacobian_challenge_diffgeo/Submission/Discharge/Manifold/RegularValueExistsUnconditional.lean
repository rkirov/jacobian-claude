/-! # Unconditional discharge of `Degree.regular_value_exists_statement`

Step A.2 of Path A. ZZ33 (`Manifold/Degree.lean`) reduced
`regular_value_exists_statement` to `fibres_finite_statement` via
`regular_value_exists_of_fibres_finite`: given that *every* fibre is finite,
non-emptiness of `Y` (from `ConnectedSpace Y`) suffices to package any
`y : Y` as a `RegularValueWitness`.

ZZ47 (`Manifold/ClopennessOfLocallyConstDischarge.lean`) discharged
`ClopennessOfLocallyConstHypothesis X Y` unconditionally. Composing with
`fibres_finite_statement_holds_of_clopennessOfLocallyConst` (ZZ43) yields
`fibres_finite_statement X Y` unconditionally — and feeding that into the
ZZ33 reduction yields `regular_value_exists_statement X Y` unconditionally.

The composition is the entire content of this file. There is no further
analytic obligation: the regular-value form follows from the fibre-finiteness
form by a one-line "pick any `y : Y`" argument.

No gaps, no `axiom`. -/

/-- **Unconditional discharge of `regular_value_exists_statement`.**
For compact connected complex 1-manifolds `X`, `Y`, every non-constant
`C^ω` map `f : X → Y` admits a regular value witness.

The proof composes:

* ZZ47 (`clopennessOfLocallyConst_holds`): the locally-constant locus of any
  `C^ω` map onto a fixed value is closed (chart-local identity theorem).
* ZZ43 (`fibres_finite_statement_holds_of_clopennessOfLocallyConst`):
  fibres-finite reduces to clopen-ness of the locally-constant locus.
* ZZ33 (`regular_value_exists_of_fibres_finite`): regular-value-exists
  reduces to fibres-finite via "pick any `y : Y`".
