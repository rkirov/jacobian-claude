/-! # Hurwitz constant-card, staged on `h_path` (ZZ160, ZZ172-corrected)

Compose ZZ155 (`fibre_card_well_defined_at_regular_holds_of_lc_ncard_and_topo`)
with ZZ159 (`h_topo_of_h_path`) so that the *only* topological residual
exposed at the headline is the manifold-lift content `(M1)`:

```
∀ C : Set Y, C.Finite → (Cᶜ).Nonempty → IsPathConnected (Cᶜ : Set Y).
```

When `(M1)` lands unconditionally (target of ZZ165), this theorem
becomes one rewrite away from the strict-closure of the constant-card
statement.

## What this file does and does not deliver

This file *stages* the topological side. ZZ155 still needs the analytic
content this file does not — and cannot, at the present pin — discharge:

* **Per-`f` regular-subset packaging.** The consumer supplies, for every
  non-constant analytic `f`, a finite set `C ⊆ Y` such that
  - every `RegularValueWitnessReg f` has its `value` in `Cᶜ`, and
  - the fibre-cardinality `(f ⁻¹' {y}).ncard` is locally constant on `Cᶜ`.

  Specialising `C := f.criticalValues` is what ZZ100 produces under a
  `CriticalSetWitness` for `f : MeromorphicNonzero X` (Riemann-sphere
  target). For an arbitrary `f : X → Y` between general complex
  1-manifolds, no unconditional packaging is available at this pin.

The wrapper below therefore exposes the analytic packaging as a single
`h_pkg` parameter, with `h_path` factored out via ZZ159 so the
*topological* residual is the single named manifold-lift content `(M1)`.

Compared with the pre-ZZ172 version, the universally-false `h_C_fin`
hypothesis (which asserted that *every* set in `Y` is finite) is removed.
The `C` finiteness is instead supplied by the per-`f` packaging.

No gaps, no `axiom`. -/

/-- **Hurwitz constant-card, staged on `h_path` (ZZ172-corrected).**

Given:

* `h_path` — manifold-lift `(M1)`: the complement of any finite set in
  `Y` is path-connected (when nonempty). This is the *single* named
  topological residual; ZZ159 turns it into the `IsPreconnected`
  hypothesis that ZZ134 consumes.
* `h_pkg` — per-`f` packaging: existence of a finite `C ⊆ Y` with
  - regular witnesses' values in `Cᶜ`,
  - locally-constant fibre-ncard on `Cᶜ`.

Conclude the unfolded form of `fibre_card_well_defined_at_regular_statement`.

When ZZ165 lands `h_path` unconditionally as a theorem of complex
1-manifolds, this wrapper closes to a one-input statement parameterised
only on the per-`f` analytic packaging. -/
